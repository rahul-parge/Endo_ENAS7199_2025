<p class="h1">Abstract</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Background:</span> Pre-existing Diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM.  The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Objective:</span> To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Methods:</span> The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy.  The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs), evaluating the effects of different interventions (e.g., PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes including Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from two patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Results:</span>  In individuals with diabetes who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_PPOO">&oplus;&oplus;OO</a>) This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC - including contraception as a key component- showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HgbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception.  </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with type 2 diabetes, we suggest discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester.  (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">In pregnant individuals with PDM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) This was suggested based on the GDP judgement that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of Large for Gestational Age (LGA) infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of Small for Gestational Age (SGA) infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition.</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with (PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate restricted diet (&lt;175 g per day) or usual diet (&gt;175 g per day) during pregnancy. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) The GDP determined that the limited available evidence was too indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175 g/day.</p>
<p class="text">In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) There is a lack of direct evidence supporting CGM use for T2DM in pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM. </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24 hour continuous glucose monitor CGM target &lt; 140 mg/dl (7.8mmol/L) in place of standard of care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting &lt;95 mg/dl (5.3 mmol/L), 1 hr. post prandial &lt;140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L), 2hr post prandial &lt; 120 md/dl (6.7mmol/L) (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)  This was suggested based on indirect evidence  that associated  adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl (7mmol/L).</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated increased time in range (TIR) (MD 3.62%; CI: 3.17-10.41) and reduced time below range (TBR) (MD -0.94%; CI: -1.82 - -0.07) with the use of hybrid close loop pump technology. </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest post-partum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and again both reduced Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. There is also the potential for a reduction in maternal hypoglycemia and improved rates of breast feeding. </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Conclusion:</span> The data supporting these recommendations was of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy.  Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.</p>
<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
<p class="text">Pre-existing diabetes (PDM) is defined as any type of diabetes diagnosed prior to the current pregnancy. The prevalence of PDM has doubled in the last 20 years and now complicates about 1% of pregnancies worldwide, ranging from 0.5% in Europe, to 2% in the United States, and up to 2.4% in Africa and the Middle East (<a href="1">1</a>).PDM significantly increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, as shown in <span class="bold">Table 1 and Table 2 </span>(<a href="2">2</a>). </p>
<p class="text">Specialized diabetes care throughout all stages of the reproductive cycle is needed to improve pregnancy outcomes (<span class="bold">Figure 1</span>). PCC is widely recommended to optimize glycemia, address treatment for obesity, manage the increasing complexity of new therapeutics and technologies, and screen for and treat diabetes complications as well as ensure initiation of folic acid supplementation (<a href="3">3</a>). Despite strong evidence that PCC, focused on achieving glycemic targets before conception, reduces the risk of miscarriage, congenital malformations, and other adverse outcomes, the large gaps in education, access, and care result in missed opportunities (<a href="4">4</a>). Improvements in glycemia during the prenatal period improve outcomes, but, even with expert care, both glycemia and outcomes remain suboptimal (<a href="5">5</a>). Supporting a healthy lifestyle, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and mental health is important throughout the lifecycle (<a href="6">6</a>,<a href="7">7</a>). Nutrition during pregnancy is especially important, as maternal nutrition has been shown to impact offspring health for generations through epigenetic changes (<a href="8">8</a>).</p>
<p class="text">With the rapid advancement of new diabetes technology promising improvement in glycemia to near-normal levels during pregnancy, there is an urgent need to optimize the use of these new technologies in this particularly at-risk population. Delivery is an especially critical point for both mothers and offspring. Understanding how to reduce maternal and neonatal risks during this vulnerable time is essential. The postpartum period is often when those with PDM need the most support. Their recovery is more likely to be complicated by surgical complications, postpartum hypertension, and increased glycemic variability, in addition to the physical and emotional demands of breastfeeding and neonatal care. Glycemic management during this time is essential for maintaining maternal health, reducing maternal hypoglycemia, supporting breastfeeding, and optimizing this new potential preconception period.</p>
<p class="h1">List of Recommendations</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 1 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should a screening question about pregnancy intention vs. no screening question be used in every healthcare provider appointment for individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 1</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with diabetes who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent should also be addressed at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical remarks</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of screening. </p>
<p class="listlevel1">A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is optimization of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital malformations. The GDP suggests that for screening for pregnancy intent to be effective, three actions are required: </p>
<p class="listlevel3">Provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC </p>
<p class="listlevel3">Evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning referral</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy. </p>
<p class="listlevel1">This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of PDM, including T1DM and T2DM. </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 2 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should contraception vs. no contraception be used in individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 2</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired.  (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_PPOO">&oplus;&oplus;OO</a>)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical Remark</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">Clinician counseling about contraception should be noncoercive and patient-centered. Shared decision-making should prioritize an individual’s autonomy and be informed by the clinician’s expertise.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 3  </span></p>
<p class="text">Should discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist (GLP-1RA) before pregnancy vs. GLP-1RA discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester be used in individuals with pre-existing type 2 diabetes? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 3 </span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with type 2 diabetes, we suggest discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester.  (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical remarks</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">Sudden discontinuation of GLP-1RA may cause hyperglycemia and weight gain, which increases the risk for congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion. Timely transition and titration of alternative antihyperglycemic agents after discontinuing GLP-1 RAs is necessary to minimize hyperglycemia.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">The timing of discontinuation prior to pregnancy is individualized based on the anticipated likelihood of conception after discontinuing contraception, type of GLP-1 RA used, and risks of prolonged time off GLP-1 RAs prior to pregnancy.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Active management of glycemia is required. </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 4 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should insulin vs. insulin with the addition of metformin be used in pregnant individuals with pre-existing diabetes type 2? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 4 </span></p>
<p class="text">In pregnant individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 5 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should a carbohydrate restricted (&lt;175 g per day) diet vs. usual diet (&gt;175 g per day) during pregnancy be used in individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM)? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 5</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM), we suggest either a carbohydrate restricted diet (&lt;175 g per day) or usual diet (&gt;175 g per day) during pregnancy. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical remarks </span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">There is no clear evidence on the optimal amount of carbohydrate intake; however, lower and higher extremes are harmful based on indirect evidence. </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 6 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) vs. no CGM (self-monitoring blood glucose [SMBG] as standard of care) be used in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)?</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 6</span></p>
<p class="text">In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical remarks</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">Both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives for monitoring glucose during pregnancy, however, in individuals with T2DM, there is limited direct evidence for this. CGM may offer a potential advantage vs. SBGM in certain subgroups of preexisting Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % Time in Range (TIR) for individuals for T2DM may be different compared to those which have demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 7</span></p>
<p class="text">Should a single continuous glucose monitor (CGM) target &lt; 140 mg/dl (7.8mmol/L) be used vs standard of care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting &lt;95 mg/dl (5.3 mmol/L), 1 hr. post prandial &lt;140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L), 2hr post prandial &lt; 120 md/dl (6.7mmol/L) in individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) using CGM?</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 7</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), we suggest against the use of single 24 hour continuous glucose monitor (CGM) target &lt; 140 mg/dl (7.8mmol/L) in place of standard of care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting &lt;95 mg/dl (5.3 mmol/L), 1 hr. post prandial &lt;140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/L), 2hr post prandial &lt; 120 md/dl (6.7mmol/L) (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical Remark</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">When CGM is used in individuals with preexisting diabetes, providers and patients should use fasting and postprandial glucose targets (whether measured by CGM or SMBG) as the basis for insulin adjustment and not a single glucose target of 63-140 mg/dl.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">This recommendation applies to all types of PDM, including T1DM and T2DM.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">There is limited data on the appropriate lower limit of the target for fasting or post prandial glucose in pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 8 </span></p>
<p class="text">Should a hybrid closed loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) vs. insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM be used in individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are pregnant? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 8 </span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical Remark</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">The individual algorithms used in HCL technology vary in their effects on glucometrics and, presumably, on clinical outcomes as well. The decision to use HCL technology—and which specific system to choose—should be made by the patient in collaboration with a clinician experienced in both diabetes management during pregnancy and diabetes technology.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Question 9</span></p>
<p class="text">Should early delivery based on risk assessment vs. expectant management be used in individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM)? </p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 9</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM), we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical Remarks </span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">There are no validated obstetric risk assessment tools for individuals with pre-existing diabetes.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Risk-assessment criteria that may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing include the history of diabetes-related complications, measures of glycemia, ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, and presence of other comorbidities associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Risks may outweigh any benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation, even among those with ideal glycemic management.</p>
<p class="text"><span class="bold">Recommendation 10</span></p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes (including those with
pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest post-partum endocrine care
(diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care. (2 |
⊕OOO)</p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical Remark</span></p>

<p class="listlevel1">In addition to routine obstetric care, immediate postpartum care
for individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) should
prioritize glycemic management to support healing, promote lactation,
and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes
management.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Ideally, postpartum diabetes care should be delivered by a
multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes
and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified
diabetes care and education specialists. This team should also support
ongoing, long-term established follow-up.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">In many cases, postpartum care also serves as preconception care
(PCC) for a future pregnancy. Approximately half of all deliveries occur
among individuals who already have at least one child, highlighting the
opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to PCC. There
is strong evidence that preconception care improves several pregnancy
outcomes in individuals with PDM.</p>
<p class="h1">Methods of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines</p>
<p class="text">This guideline was developed jointly by the Endocrine Society and
European Society of Endocrinology using the process detailed on the
Endocrine Society website (<a
href="https://www.endocrine.org/clinical-practice-guidelines/methodology">https://www.endocrine.org/clinical-practice-guidelines/methodology</a>) and
summarized here. The primary goal of the Guideline Development Panel
(GDP) was to provide recommendations for the care of individuals with
PDM. This focus arises from the increasing prevalence of pre-existing
diabetes among pregnant individuals and the central role that
endocrinologists play in their care. The panel identified many important
clinical questions regarding the care of individuals with pre-existing
diabetes during pregnancy. However, due to limited resources, we
prioritized 10 of these questions and focused on five key clinical
outcomes deemed critical for decision-making for each. The GDP followed
the GRADE methodology (Tables 3 and 4) (<a href="9">9</a>), which includes the evidence
to decision (EtD) framework to ensure all important criteria are
considered when making recommendations (<a href="10">10</a>,<a href="11">11</a>). The process was
facilitated by the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GRADEpro GDT)
(<a href="12">12</a>). The GDP included 2 co-Chairs and 15 content experts representing
the following specialties: adult endocrinology, general internal
medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, nutrition,
diabetes education, and pharmacology. Two patient representatives with
lived life experience of diabetes and pregnancy were also included on
the panel. Members were identified by the Endocrine Society (ES) and
European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) Boards of Directors and the ES
Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) and ESE Clinical Committee and were
vetted according to the ES conflict-of-interest policy (Endocrine
Society 2019), which was followed throughout the guideline process to
manage and mitigate conflicts of interest. Detailed disclosures of GDP
members and the management strategies implemented during the development
process can be found in Appendix A. Overall, 36% of panel members
reported potentially relevant conflict of interest. In addition, the
group included a clinical practice guideline methodologist from the Mayo
Evidence-Based Practice Center, who led the team that conducted the
systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and a methodologist from the ES,
who advised on methodology and moderated the application of the EtD
framework and development of the recommendations.</p>
<p class="text">Two to three GDP members were assigned to lead each guideline
question. The ten clinical questions addressed in this guideline were
prioritized from an extensive list of potential questions through a
survey of the GDP members and discussion. The Mayo Evidence-Based
Practice Center conducted a systematic review for each question and
produced GRADE evidence profiles that summarized the body of evidence
for each question and the certainty of that evidence (<a href="13">13</a>). Systematic
searches for evidence were conducted in February 2022 and updated in
February 2025. In parallel with the development of the evidence
summaries, the GDP members searched for and summarized research evidence
for other EtD criteria, such as individuals’ values and preferences,
costs and resources required, cost-effectiveness, feasibility,
acceptability, and the potential impact on health equity. Evidence from
randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized for the systematic
reviews. In the absence of primary RCTs, the GDP considered evidence
from comparative observational studies and indirect evidence from
alternative populations or interventions deemed to be clinically
comparable. Evidence from RCTs supports three recommendations (rec 2, 4
and 8), while the rest are based on observational data or indirect
evidence from acceptable alternative populations and interventions,
which limits the certainty of the supporting evidence (<a href="14">14</a>). For example,
drawing conclusions from studies performed in nonpregnant populations is
suboptimal, as it ignores both the unique physiology of pregnancy and
the impact of an intervention on the fetus. Results from studies in
individuals with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may not be
generalizable to pre-existing diabetes. Similarly, distinctions must be
drawn for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in pregnancy. For two recommendations, the
panel considered both of the evaluated alternatives to be acceptable
without suggesting one over the other due to the high level of
uncertainty regarding the net benefits or harms of the evaluated
alternatives and other evidence-to-decision (EtD) criteria (<a href="15">15</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the panel considered all elements of
the EtD framework, including stakeholder values and preferences (with
input from clinical experts and two patient representatives), costs and
resource requirements, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility,
and potential impacts on health equity. However, the panel did not find
robust evidence for most of these EtD factors in relation to the
clinical questions, highlighting the need for research in these
areas.</p>
<p class="text">Research evidence summaries noted in the EtD frameworks were compiled
using standardized terminology templates for clarity and consistency
(<a href="16">16</a>). During an in-person GDP meeting and a series of video conferences,
the GDP judged the balance of benefits and harms, in addition to the
other EtD criteria, to determine the direction and strength of each

<p class="h1">Screening For Pregnancy Intention  </p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Unfavorable pregnancy outcomes are common in individuals with PDM and
are related to modifiable factors such as maternal hyperglycemia and
body mass index (BMI) (<a href="20">20</a>). For outcomes such as congenital
malformations (<a href="21">21</a>) or miscarriage (<a href="22">22</a>), the exposure period begins weeks
before the pregnancy is recognized. The World Health Organization (WHO)
defines PCC as "a set of interventions that are to be provided before
pregnancy, to promote the health and well-being of women and couples, as
well as to improve the pregnancy and child-health outcomes" (<a href="23">23</a>). The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines PCC as
interventions that aim to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral,
and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy outcome through
prevention and management. (<a href="24">24</a>). As pregnancies are often unplanned
(<a href="25">25</a>), PCC, including a focus on optimizing maternal glycemia, is
necessary to improve maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes (<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="4">4</a>,<a href="26">26</a>).
Therefore, understanding the effect of screening for pregnancy intention
was deemed a priority.</p>
<p class="text">Screening for pregnancy intention in the general population includes
initiatives such as the ONE KEY QUESTION<span class="text-sup">®</span> (OKQ), developed by
the Oregon Foundation for Reproductive Health (<a href="27">27</a>). This initiative
proposes that primary care clinicians ask individuals “Would you like to
become pregnant in the next year?”. For those who answer “yes”, the
clinician offers preconception counseling and screenings to ensure that
modifiable risk factors are addressed before pregnancy. For those who
answer “no”, the clinician provides counseling on the full range of
contraceptive options to ensure that the method they use is optimal for
their circumstances. This approach is endorsed by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine (<a href="28">28</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Question 1 </p>
<p class="text">Should a screening question about pregnancy intention vs. no
screening question be used in every healthcare provider appointment for
individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming
pregnant? </p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 1  </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with diabetes who have the possibility of becoming
pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy
intention at every reproductive, diabetes and primary care
visit.  Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/
emergency room visits when clinically appropriate. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="text"><span class="italic">Technical remarks</span></p>

<p class="listlevel1">There are no data supporting a specific timing or frequency of
screening.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">A critical component of preconception care (PCC) is optimization
of glycemia to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital
malformations. The GDP suggests that for screening for pregnancy intent
to be effective, three actions are required: </p>

<p class="listlevel3">Provision of basic counseling about the benefits of PCC </p>
<p class="listlevel3">Evaluation of contraception needs and/or family planning
referral </p>
<p class="listlevel3">Referral for PCC to achieve goals of therapy. </p>
</li>
<p class="listlevel1">This recommendation applies to individuals with all types of PDM,
including T1DM and T2DM. </p>
<p class="h2">Summary of Evidence</p>
<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a
href="https://guidelines.gradepro.org/staging/profiles/1PAEgaVAt10">https://guidelines.gradepro.org/profile/1PAEgaVAt10</a></p>
<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review did not identify any RCT examining the effects
of a screening question about pregnancy intention in individuals with
diabetes on the following outcomes:</p>

<p class="listlevel1">Contraception prescription</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Referral for PCC</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Unplanned pregnancy</p>
<p class="listlevel1">HbA1C at the first prenatal visit</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Congenital malformations</p>

<p class="text">The GDP found indirect evidence for the effects of PCC on HbA1C at
the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. The GDP also
found indirect evidence for the benefits of a screening question asking
about pregnancy intention and contraceptive use on documentation of
contraceptive use but not on contraception prescribing. The GDP found no
indirect evidence for the outcomes of unplanned pregnancy or referral
for PCC.</p>
<p class="text">The indirect evidence supporting this recommendation includes
multiple studies that demonstrate the association of PCC on HbA1C at the
first prenatal visit and congenital malformation in individuals with
diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 studies (34 cohort
studies) with 8,199 participants demonstrated that PCC was associated
with a lower HbA1C in the first trimester by an average of –1.27% (mean
difference [MD], -1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.33–1.22; 4,927
participants; 24 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and with a lower
rate of congenital malformations (risk ratio [RR], 0.29 [0.21–0.40])
with high certainty (25 studies; 5,903 participants) (<a href="4">4</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The GDP identified further indirect evidence supporting this
recommendation, as a pre-visit question was found to improve
documentation of contraceptive use. In a cluster RCT, academic
internists who were randomized to the intervention group (<span class="italic">n</span> =
26) were provided with information on their female individuals'
pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use as a “vital sign” taken
immediately before visits, while academic internists in the control
group (<span class="italic">n</span> = 27) received only standard intake information. Data
were abstracted for 5,371 visits from 2,304 individuals. Screening in
the intervention group increased documentation of contraceptive use from
a baseline of 23% to 57% in the intervention group but was unchanged at
28% in the control group (<span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;.001). Additionally, for
visits involving teratogenic medications, documentation of contraceptive
use increased from 14% to 48% in the intervention group compared with a
decrease from 29% to 26% in the control group (<span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;.001)
However, the intervention had minimal impact on documented provision of
family planning services (<a href="29">29</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The GDP did not identify any indirect evidence of harm from the
screening question on any of the five outcomes. One potentially
undesirable effect of PCC is maternal hypoglycemia in the first
trimester, which was evaluated in the meta-analysis of Wahabi et al (<a href="4">4</a>)
There was very low certainty about the effect of PCC on maternal
hypoglycemia during the first trimester (RR, 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07–1.79;
three studies; 686 participants). The grade of evidence was downgraded
from low to very low due to inconsistency of the direction of effect and
high heterogeneity (<span class="italic">I<span class="text-sup">2</span></span> = 76%) in the included
studies (<a href="4">4</a>). The GDP deemed the final goal of a screening question about
pregnancy intention to be receipt of PCC and access to
contraception.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Consideration</p>
<p class="text">Women with T1DM express concerns about the effect of high glucose on
the health of their infant (<a href="30">30</a>). Although we did not find studies of the
value placed on the respective outcomes prioritized, the GDP judged that
reducing congenital malformations would be of very high importance for
most individuals.</p>
<p class="text">The resources needed depend on how screening is implemented and could
be substantial. Medical record modifications and staff/clinician time
are required. PCC increases use of services, including diabetes
education, nutrition counseling, contraception, and medical care.</p>
<p class="text">We did not identify any study directly evaluating cost-effectiveness
of pregnancy intention screening. We did find cost-effectiveness data
derived from estimates of PCC. The GDP judged that the indirect evidence
for the cost-effectiveness of PCC favors screening those with diabetes
for pregnancy intention. A U.S. study estimated that the cost of PCC (20
preconception visits) was $3,676 (1992 USD). However, the reduction in
costs for maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay, neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and long-term costs related to
congenital malformations resulted in cost savings of $1.86 for every
dollar spent (<a href="31">31</a>). An Irish study in 2016 demonstrated that attendees of
a PCC clinic had adjusted difference in complication costs €2578.00
lower than usual antenatal care (<a href="32">32</a>). A qualitative systematic review of
six economic evaluation studies of PCC that included 1,800 individuals
with diabetes (among other clinical contexts), found that PCC was likely
to be cost-effective regarding specific health outcomes (<a href="33">33</a>). A study
that modeled the impact of PCC resulted in large societal and health
care cost savings (<a href="34">34</a>). Estimating that 2.2% of U.S. births are to
individuals with known PDM, universal PCC might avert 8,397 (90%
prediction interval [PI], 5,252–11,449) preterm deliveries, 3,725 (90%
PI, 3,259–4,126) birth defects, and 1,872 (90% PI, 1,239–2,415)
perinatal deaths annually in the United States. Associated discounted
lifetime costs averted for the affected cohort of children could be as
high as $4.3 billion (90% PI, 3.4–5.1 billion in 2012 USD (<a href="34">34</a>).</p>
<p class="text">We did not identify any studies that evaluated the effect of the
intervention on health equity, nor did we find any studies that applied
a reproductive justice framework to PCC for individuals with diabetes.
It should be noted that the burden of unintended pregnancy is higher in
minoritized populations (<a href="35">35</a>). This is of particular importance because
the GDP identified disparities in access to PCC and in pregnancy
outcomes for individuals with diabetes. Minoritized populations are also
at risk for biased or coercive reproductive health counseling (<a href="36">36</a>). The
intervention could have a positive impact on health equity if
implemented with appropriate attention to addressing interpersonal and
structural barriers, including local policies that restrict reproductive
health care. However, inconsistent or biased implementation could worsen
disparities in pregnancy outcomes.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP evaluated reproductive intention screening to be acceptable
to individuals with diabetes. A systematic review of screening for
reproductive intention in a primary care setting identified 7 studies
that measured acceptability and participant satisfaction, both of which
were high in all 7 studies (<a href="37">37</a>). Another systematic review identified 53
U.S.-based studies using 22 screening tools and standardized approaches
to preconception, inter-conception and reproductive health, evaluating a
variety of outcomes (<a href="38">38</a>). Five studies included adolescents with either
T1DM or T2DM. Adolescent participants in the Randomized Efficacy Trial
of Early Preconception Counseling for Diabetic Teens (READY-Girls) study
found the screening and educational tools to be acceptable. Findings
included increased knowledge about reproductive health and the benefits
of PCC as well as intentions to seek PCC before a future pregnancy
(<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="38">38</a>,<a href="39">39</a>). It is important to note that none of these studies were
conducted in the context of local policies that eliminate access to
termination of pregnancy, which may impact the acceptability of
screening for pregnancy intent.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP determined that the feasibility of reproductive screening
varied based on limitations on clinician time, clinician comfort
discussing contraception, and varied resources for referrals for
PCC/contraceptive counseling/prescribing. Lack of sufficient time,
clinician self-efficacy, and resources to provide subsequent care are
barriers to implementation (<a href="32">32</a>,<a href="40">40-44</a>). A quality improvement (QI)
intervention at a single U.S. academic outpatient endocrinology practice
was initiated to improve rates of PCC and contraception prescribing by
endocrinologists to individuals with diabetes. The intervention included
distribution of electronic education reminders about diabetes in
pregnancy and contraceptive options to clinicians as well as teaching
materials for individuals and simplified note templates for
documentation. After the intervention, contraception discussion at the
visit increased from 4% to 18% (<span class="italic">P</span> = 0.03), while the increases
in contraception prescription (from 0% to 2%) and PCC (from 0% to 6%)
were not significant (<a href="40">40</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">Given the high prevalence of maternal and fetal complications in
individuals with PDM and indirect evidence of large beneficial effects
on the risk for congenital malformations and moderate benefit for first
trimester HbA1C reduction with PCC, the GDP judged that screening
individuals with diabetes for pregnancy intention is likely of benefit
if it leads to increased uptake of PCC.</p>
<p class="text">No studies were identified that compared a screening approach to a
non-screening approach for pregnancy intention in individuals with
diabetes. Therefore, the GDP’s approach to this question followed a
framework proposed by Murad and colleagues (<a href="45">45</a>). This framework includes
a series of factors that need to be considered to support screening:</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Importance: The condition is an important health problem in terms
of prevalence and/or consequences.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The GDP noted that lack of pregnancy planning has been linked to
important health problems in individuals with PDM.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Natural history: The condition for which screening is being
performed has a well-understood natural history that includes a latent
(preclinical) phase.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The GDP agreed that the adverse effects of lack of pregnancy
planning might manifest only after a latency period and that early
intervention could improve these outcomes.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Difference in management and treatment availability: Those with
positive screening test results would be managed differently from those
with negative screening test results.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The GDP agreed that the management will differ for individuals
who screen positive (i.e., pregnancy intention) vs. negative and that
resources and management strategies exist (PCC) for both
groups.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Test accuracy and safety: High- or moderate-certainty evidence
supports acceptable accuracy of the screening test (e.g., acceptable
false-positive and false-negative rates).</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The screening intervention in this situation (i.e., pregnancy
intent) is obtained directly from the individuals with diabetes who have
the possibility of becoming pregnant<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p class="listlevel1">Available treatment: Effective management is available that
improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent
(preclinical) phase.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">PCC is available, and the identified systematic reviews showcase
positive effects in the outcomes of interest.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Difference in outcomes: The benefits of management according to
screening results outweigh the harms of screening (e.g., overdiagnosis,
unnecessary treatment for false positives, anxiety, stigma, etc.).</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The GDP did not identify any harms related to a screening
question other than the financial costs associated with PCC according to
the individual's response.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Other considerations: The screening strategy should be
cost-effective, acceptable to relevant stakeholders, and feasible to
implement.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">The provision of PCC to individuals with diabetes appeared to be
cost-effective and acceptable to individuals and clinicians, with
feasibility depending on system structures and support.</p>
<p class="text">The justification for a screening question about the possibilities of
pregnancy is based on the significant benefits for PCC, which are used
as a surrogate, and lack of considerable harm.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Two subgroups need additional consideration: adolescent girls/young
individuals with T1DM and women with T2DM. Serious adverse pregnancy
outcomes can be especially high among adolescents and young women. The
early and unpredictable timing of sexual debut, the high percentage of
individuals who have at least one episode of unprotected sex (<a href="46">46</a>), the
higher occurrence of major malformations (20.5%), and the high
prevalence of serious adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes support
early intervention to reduce risks (<a href="47">47</a>). As is true for all individuals,
contraceptive counseling for adolescents should be devoid of coercion,
involve shared decision-making, and respect individual autonomy. Access
to contraception for adolescents should be available prior to sexual
debut.</p>
<p class="text">Women with T2DM may have lower awareness of pregnancy risks related
to diabetes and reduced PCC attendance than do those with T1DM (<a href="48">48</a>), as
well as increased risk for certain adverse outcomes (<a href="20">20</a>,<a href="49">49</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Direct evidence from pragmatic RCTs is needed to evaluate the benefit
of the intervention of a screening question in individuals with diabetes
who could become pregnant. Implementation studies are also needed.
Suggested studies include:</p>

<p class="listlevel1">Evaluating how a screening question about pregnancy intention
changes rates of 1) contraception prescription or referral to a family
planning clinic, 2) referral for PCC, 3) unplanned pregnancy, 4) HbA1C
at first prenatal visit, and 5) congenital malformations</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Evaluating whether pairing a screening question about pregnancy
intention and a screening question about immediate contraceptive needs
increases referrals for PCC or to a family planning clinic and
contraceptive use and reduces unplanned pregnancies and congenital
malformations as well as decreases HbA1C at the first prenatal
visit.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Comparing the outcomes of interest and associated costs/savings
among various approaches to screening for pregnancy intention; these
approaches could include automated direct communication to individuals,
automated reminders to clinic staff to prescreen at visits, and
automated reminders to clinicians to screen regarding pregnancy
intention during visits with protocols streamlining referrals for PCC
and/or contraception provision. Similarly, evaluating the effects of
different intervals of screening (e.g., annually) and ideal healthcare
settings (e.g., primary care, urgent care) can clarify the downstream
effects of screening for pregnancy intent.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Addressing the knowledge gap of endocrinologists and primary care
clinicians regarding safe and effective contraceptive
prescribing.</p>
<p class="h1">Contraception</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">In women with DM, unplanned pregnancies or pregnancies occurring
during periods of suboptimal maternal health can result in adverse
outcomes for both the mother and fetus (<a href="4">4</a>,<a href="20">20</a>). Contraception is key in
preventing such situations, but there are a number of issues with
contraception in this population, including a lower prevalence of use
than that observed in the general population (<a href="50">50</a>), factors potentially
affecting contraception effectiveness such as obesity (<a href="51">51</a>,<a href="52">52</a>) and
treatments for diabetes or obesity such as GLP-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1RAs) or malabsorptive bariatric surgery (<a href="53">53</a>,<a href="54">54</a>). Also, both
GLP-1RAs and bariatric surgery can increase fertility through weight
loss (<a href="55">55</a>). Additionally, there are safety concerns specific to this
population which likely contribute to health care practitioners’ feeling
of unease in prescribing contraception and which, in turn, may help
explain the low use of contraception among women with diabetes (<a href="56">56</a>).The
GDP judged the problem to be a priority.</p>
<p class="h2">Question 2</p>
<p class="text">Should contraception vs. no contraception be used in individuals with
diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant? </p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 2</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of
becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not
desired. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_PPOO">&oplus;&oplus;OO</a>)</p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remarks</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Clinician counseling about contraception should be noncoercive
and patient centered. Shared decision-making should prioritize an
individual’s autonomy and be informed by the clinician’s
expertise.</p>
<p class="h2">Summary of Evidence</p>
<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review did not identify any RCTs evaluating the effect
of contraception use (all contraceptive methods) by individuals with
diabetes who could become pregnant on:</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Preconception care</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Unplanned pregnancies</p>
<p class="listlevel1">HbA1C at the time of the first prenatal visit</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Congenital malformations</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Miscarriages or terminations</p>

<p class="text">The GDP put weight on indirect evidence in the general population,
which suggested large effects of contraception in reducing unplanned
pregnancies and terminations. Additionally, in women with diabetes,
indirect evidence highlighted the role of PCC including contraception in
improving first-trimester HbA1C and preventing congenital malformations.
This judgement was supported by the plausibility of the associations,
despite the bias inherent to observational studies, which constitute the
vast majority of those addressing PCC in women with diabetes.</p>
<p class="text">All contraceptive methods can be expected to reduce the risk of
unwanted pregnancies. The CHOICE project involved a prospective cohort
of more than 9,000 women from the general population and showed how
offering effective, no-cost reversible contraception for 2 to 3 years
had an impact on reducing unplanned pregnancies and terminations .Using
teen pregnancies as a surrogate of unplanned pregnancies, from 2008 to
2013 period, the mean annual rates of unplanned pregnancies among CHOICE
participants were much lower than the corresponding national rates given
for comparison (34.0 and 158.5 per 1,000 teens, respectively) (<a href="57">57</a>,<a href="58">58</a>).
Similarly, the abortion rate in CHOICE participants from 2008 to 2010
was less than half the regional and national rates (4.4 to 7.5% in
CHOICE participants, 13.4 to 17.0% regional rates, 19.6%o national
rates, p&lt;0.001) (<a href="59">59</a>). The more frequent choice of long-acting
reversible contraception (LARC) methods and its effectiveness were key
for these outcomes (<a href="60">60</a>). This was especially true for adolescents and
women younger than age 21 years who had significantly higher
discontinuation rates of short-acting reversible contraception (SARC)
methods (51%, ages 14–19 years vs. 41%, ages 20–45 years) (<a href="61">61</a>) and were
twice as likely as older women using the same method to experience an
unintended pregnancy (hazard rate 1.9, CI 95% 1.2-2.8), while this was
not the case in LARC users (<a href="62">62</a>). Similarly, a systematic review and
meta-analysis published in 2020 reported that young women were less
likely to choose LARC than SARC methods (RR, 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17–0.80),
while continuation rates were higher in LARC users (RR, 1.60; 95% CI:
1.21–2.12) (<a href="63">63</a>). The effectiveness of contraception in reducing
unintended pregnancies and terminations has also been shown in a recent
RCT with a cluster design conducted in China. The intervention included
face-to-face education, videos, and educational pamphlets delivered at
five points during pregnancy and postpartum, aligned with usual care.
Among 1,279 participants with a 78% follow-up at 1 year, the
intervention reduced unintended pregnancies and terminations to one
third (OR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.16–0.70 for unintended pregnancies and OR,
0.30; 95% CI: 0.09–0.99 for terminations respectively) (<a href="64">64</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Contraception is anticipated to facilitate the opportunity of PCC.
Hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs), combined oral contraceptives
(COCs) and with limited evidence, progestin only contraceptives, have
minimal impact on glycemic regulation and lipid profile and, by allowing
time to optimize diabetes management before pregnancy, contraception is
expected to contribute to improved HbA1C levels at the first prenatal
consultation (<a href="52">52</a>,<a href="65">65</a>). A lower rate of congenital malformations and
miscarriages due to a reduction in periconceptional hyperglycemia can
also be anticipated. Further supporting evidence favoring contraception
comes from its use being a component of the PCC intervention as defined
in the systematic reviews of Wahabi et al. that showed significant
improvement in two outcomes of interest: HbA1C in the first trimester
and congenital malformations, as previously described (<a href="4">4</a>,<a href="66">66</a>,<a href="67">67</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Overall, the GDP deemed the undesirable anticipated effects of
contraception in women with diabetes to be trivial in comparison with
pregnancy. Several Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for contraceptive
use are available, including those from World Health Organization (<a href="68">68</a>),
United Kingdom (<a href="69">69</a>) and United States (US MEC, published in 2024). As
the US MEC is the most recent, it has been used as the primary reference
for this guideline. The recent U.S. MEC and Selected Practice
Recommendations for Contraceptive Use, 2024 provide recommendations for
women with diabetes based on the duration of the disease and the
presence and severity of complications (<a href="51">51</a>) (<a href="52">52</a>). IUDs, progestin-only
pills, and implants fall under categories US MEC 1 (no restriction of
use) or US MEC 2 (may require closer monitoring). The MEC 2
classification for progestin-only contraceptives in this population is
due to an increased risk of thrombosis, although the risk is
substantially lower than for COCs. For women with diabetes and
complications, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) falls under US
MEC 3 (risks may outweigh the benefits), a higher category than for
other progestin-only methods due to concerns about DMPA’s hypoestrogenic
effects and reduction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol
levels. For women with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia,
drospirenone-only pills fall under US MEC 4 due to antimineralcorticoid
activity of drospirenone. Finally, COCs fall under US MEC 2 for women
without complications; US MEC 3 for women with non-severe complications;
and US MEC 4 for women with established vascular disease, nephropathy,
retinopathy; or long duration of the disease, due to the estimated
additive risk of thrombosis from both factors.</p>
<p class="text">The risk of any thromboembolism, either venous or arterial, in women
with T1DM or T2DM was assessed in a U.S. report using data from
contraception claims (<a href="70">70</a>). The absolute risk in women with diabetes
using hormonal contraception was low, but it was higher than in
non-users and differed by age. Among women younger than age 35 years
using estrogen-containing contraceptives, the absolute rate of
thrombosis was 10.0 events per 1,000 woman-years of use vs 3.4 in
non-users, while in women 35 years and older, the corresponding risks
were 11.8 and 7.7. As venous events accounted for one third of the total
events, the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) would be threefold
lower than the risk of VTE in an unintended pregnancy in women with PDM,
estimated to be about 7.3 per 1,000 person-years considering both
antepartum and postpartum events (<a href="71">71</a>). The risk of pregnancy-related VTE
should be added to the overall risk of severe maternal morbidity in
women with PDM (<a href="72">72</a>). Risk of thrombosis was also increased in users of
transdermal patches and in women using progestin-only contraceptives
(age &lt;35 years) (<a href="70">70</a>). In a comment to the article, Braillon noted
that the European Union proposes that adverse events occurring at a
frequency of 1 to 10% be described as “common,” rates that were met in
some of the subgroups (<a href="73">73</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Regarding obesity, the aforementioned US MEC do not identify obesity
itself as a contraindication for any contraceptive method (<a href="52">52</a>), while it
should be recognized that obesity alone is a leading cause of adverse
pregnancy outcomes according to ACOG (<a href="74">74</a>). Considerations include
reports linking injectable DMPA with weight gain in adolescent girls
with obesity (<a href="75">75</a>,<a href="76">76</a>). Weight gain at 36 months can be particularly
notable in those adolescent girls who experience early weight gain
(defined as &gt;5% baseline weight gain within 6 months of DMPA use)
compared with those who do not (11.08 vs. 2.49 kg) (<a href="76">76</a>). The use of COCs
is an independent risk factor for VTE, with additive effects with high
BMI. The relative risk for COC users with obesity has consistently been
estimated to be five to eight times that of non-users with obesity, with
limited information for women with BMI above 35 kg/m<span class="text-sup">2</span>.
However, none of the individual risk factors for VTE in COC users,
including high BMI, increases the risk more than pregnancy:(<a href="77">77</a>) the
absolute VTE risk in healthy women of reproductive age is described as
small (<a href="52">52</a>) but the crude risk for VTE according to BMI and COC use is
not usually given in the literature because studies either use a
case-control design or report relative values (<a href="78">78</a>). In a retrospective
cohort study including 64,165 women ages 16 to 40 years after knee
arthroscopy, the rate of VTE was 0.95% in women without obesity or
contraceptive use, 1.62% in those with obesity, 1.72% in those with COC
use, and 3.13% in those with both obesity and COC use (<a href="79">79</a>). However,
these risks can be considered an overestimation due to the higher risk
of VTE associated with surgical intervention. In comparison, the risk of
first pregnancy-associated VTE including both the antepartum and
postpartum periods was 3.1 per 1,000 person-years in women of healthy
weight and 10.4 per 1,000 person-years in women with obesity,
respectively (<a href="71">71</a>). These risks of VTE should be added to the increased
risk of severe maternal morbidity associated with obesity in pregnancy
(<a href="80">80</a>). As to contraceptive patch or ring use, comparative studies on the
risk for VTE by weight or BMI were not identified (<a href="52">52</a>). The few studies
that have addressed acute myocardial infarction or stroke among women
with obesity who use COCs have not identified an increased risk (<a href="52">52</a>)</p>
<p class="text">Additional considerations may apply if other risk factors such as
hypertension coexist (<a href="51">51</a>,<a href="52">52</a>). Specifically, if multiple risk factors
exist, risk for cardiovascular disease might increase substantially
(<a href="52">52</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In the absence of direct evidence, but considering a large effect of
contraception use on preventing unplanned pregnancies, the GDP assessed
the certainty of evidence about the overall effects of using
contraception versus no contraception in women with diabetes who could
become pregnant to be low.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The GDP concluded that women consistently considered the selected
outcomes of high value, without major variability. Women with diabetes
express concerns about potential malformations and overall health of
their infants (<a href="81">81</a>,<a href="82">82</a>) and, although they do not specifically refer to
HbA1C, they are also concerned about their blood glucose and describe
miscarriage as a devastating experience (<a href="83">83</a>). As to PCC, women with
diabetes have acknowledged its importance and potential benefits in
various studies (<a href="48">48</a>,<a href="84">84</a>). In the general population, information on
women’s perceptions on unintended pregnancies is scarce, but they are
described as negative in reports from different countries (<a href="85">85</a>,<a href="86">86</a>).
Similarly, feelings about terminations are frequently described as
intense and negative (<a href="87">87</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Based on data from the general population, the GDP considered that
moderate costs would be required for implementation, with moderate
certainty of the evidence. Costs would include expenses related to
contraceptive methods, health care clinician training, and initiatives
to raise awareness among women (<a href="56">56</a>). Methods to achieve contraception
are usually not expensive (<a href="88">88</a>); nevertheless, cost remains as a key
barrier to access, influencing both the methods chosen and user
adherence (<a href="89">89</a>). Thus, in a retrospective cohort study involving 39,142
women with a new prescription for contraceptive pill, patch, or ring,
75% of participants were non-adherent during the study period, with
higher rates of non-adherence in those women with copayment (<a href="90">90</a>). This
is in contrast with the CHOICE project that provided contraception at no
cost, and in which 75% of participants opted for LARC methods and
displayed notably higher rates of adherence (77% for LARC users vs. 41%
for users of non-LARC methods) (<a href="91">91</a>). Thus, the ideal scenario would
involve offering a range of contraceptive methods, including LARC
methods, at no cost to women with diabetes.</p>
<p class="text">Although no studies were identified that evaluated the
cost-effectiveness of contraception in this population, the GDP
concluded that cost-effectiveness probably favors the intervention. For
this judgement, the GDP first considered evidence from women with
diabetes, in which PCC interventions that include contraception as a
component have been reported to be highly cost-beneficial (<a href="32">32</a>). Second,
the GDP weighed that different contraception strategies have proven to
be cost-effective in preventing unintended pregnancies and abortions in
women without diabetes across different scenarios (<a href="31">31</a>,<a href="59">59</a>,<a href="92">92</a>). The high
costs associated with preterm deliveries, birth defects, and perinatal
deaths in women with PDM have already been mentioned (<a href="34">34</a>); the
preconception intervention to prevent them requires effective
contraception when glucose regulation and other factors are not adequate
for pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">No studies have directly evaluated the effects of contraception use
on equity among women with diabetes. It has been reported that social
determinants of health such as household income, education attainment,
and access to counseling are among the factors that positively influence
family planning behavior (<a href="50">50</a>,<a href="93">93</a>) If improved contraception uptake would
favor highly resourced individuals, it could increase inequity, with
those with fewer resources falling further behind. However, available
data suggest that this may not be the case. In a study examining
National Composite Index for Family Planning surveys in low- and
middle-income countries, Ross et al. observed that improving access for
all to affordable contraception improved equity across wealth groups
(<a href="93">93</a>). Similarly, after elimination of cost sharing for contraception in
U.S. women, the lowest-income group had the greatest reduction in births
due to unintended pregnancies (<a href="94">94</a>). In addition, the availability of a
low-cost over-the counter (OTC) birth control pill may promote equity in
contraception access (<a href="95">95</a>) by favoring disadvantaged groups (<a href="96">96</a>). Thus,
OTC COC availability improves access for racial and ethnic minorities
(<a href="97">97</a>) as well as for adolescents (<a href="98">98</a>), segments that have reported
barriers to contraception access and high rates of non-use. Overall, the
GDP assessed that the impact on health equity of routine use of
contraception in women with diabetes could vary depending on the local
context. Local policies that limit access to termination of pregnancy
may increase the acceptability of contraception.</p>
<p class="text">The acceptability of the proposed intervention to key stakeholders
was assessed as potentially variable. A systematic review addressing
contraception in the general population across different scenarios
concluded that contraceptive values and preferences are dynamic
throughout a woman’s lifespan and that these values and preferences are
key elements women consider, alongside perceived benefits and side
effects (<a href="99">99</a>). Potential factors influencing contraception use include
religious beliefs, opinions of significant others and other family
members, and desired family size (<a href="50">50</a>,<a href="56">56</a>). In an integrative review of 19
qualitative studies, women favored methods with natural preservation of
menstruation and used negative language concerning daily hormonal and
LARC methods. Regarding IUDs, there were issues regarding autonomy and
power due to the need of a health care provider’s involvement for
insertion and removal. Power dynamics with partners also influenced
contraception use and method. Similarly, women perceived an unequal
power relationship with their health care providers, feeling that
clinicians often tried to convince them to choose a preferred method.
The study concluded that women’s desire for contraceptive control and
agency may be more important than the perceived effectiveness described
by the health care provider (<a href="100">100</a>). Among adolescents and young women,
privacy, autonomy, and safety of the contraceptive method were
identified as the key issues in a systematic review including 9,693
subjects from the general population (<a href="101">101</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The implementation of the intervention was judged as likely feasible
but with some challenges. In recent reports, pregnancy planning is
described as feasible by some women and as unrealistic by others (<a href="102">102</a>),
and it has already been mentioned that clinicians feel unease with
contraception prescription in this population <a href="28">28</a>). Similarly, a systematic
review and meta-analysis of interventions aimed at improving postpartum
contraception use in the general population reported limited success
(<a href="103">103</a>)). Additionally, there was no difference in repeat pregnancies or
induced abortions during the year following childbirth, leading the
authors to conclude that more feasible strategies are needed. On the
other hand, local policies such as the U.S. Affordable Care Act’s
elimination of cost sharing for contraception (<a href="94">94</a>). The availability of
OTC COCs (<a href="96">96</a>),and the the expanded prescribing by pharmacists will
likely improve the feasibility of the intervention in the United States
(<a href="104">104</a>,<a href="105">105</a>). A recent quality initiative to provide PCC for women with
T1DM and T2DM observed no difference in contraception prescription
despite contraception being discussed more often during the visit. Most
(80%) of health care clinicians identified inadequate time during visits
as the main reason for not providing this care (<a href="40">40</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">This recommendation is based on indirect evidence drawn from studies
conducted in both the general population and in women with diabetes. In
the general population, the availability of free contraception has been
shown to effectively prevent unplanned pregnancies and terminations.
Among women living with diabetes, observational data has shown that PCC
including contraception as a key component has a clinically significant
association with first-trimester HbA1C and with the rate of congenital
malformations. A causal relation is accepted, supported by the
plausibility of the observed associations.</p>
<p class="text">To support the conditional recommendation, the GDP placed high
importance on women’s perspectives of the acceptability of the use and
types of contraception, recognizing that this acceptability is variable,
influenced by personal beliefs, perspectives of significant others, and
dynamic throughout a woman’s lifespan.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Among individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant, there are
three important subgroups to consider (<a href="1">1</a>) Adolescent girls/young women,
(<a href="2">2</a>) Women with T2DM, as previously discussed and (<a href="3">3</a>) Women with diabetes
and obesity. Women with diabetes and accompanying obesity require
special consideration, due to the high prevalence of the association and
the potential impact of obesity on effectiveness and undesirable effects
of contraceptive methods.</p>
<p class="text">Universally, clinician counseling about contraception should be
noncoercive and patient centered. Shared decision-making should
prioritize an individual’s autonomy and be informed by the clinician’s
expertise (<a href="36">36</a>,<a href="106">106</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Among individuals with diabetes who could become pregnant, and
considering specific subgroups such as adolescents, women with obesity,
women with T2DM, and minorities, the following studies are
suggested:</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Evaluating the provision and uptake of contraception counseling,
alongside with failure rates and safety aspects to monitor real-world
status of this matter</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Generating direct evidence from RCTs evaluating interventions to
promote contraception advice, assess associated safety outcomes, and
measure its effectiveness on increasing PCC and reducing unplanned
pregnancies, congenital malformations, HbA1C at the time of the first
prenatal visit, miscarriage, and planned terminations.</p>
<p class="h1">GLP-1 Receptor Agonists</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Rates of preconception use of GLP-1RAs in individuals with T2DM are
increasing, due to their benefits in weight loss, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease and their low risk
for hypoglycemia, high efficacy, and potential to simplify treatment
regimens (<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="107">107</a>). GLP-1RAs are also being used for weight management
before conception and improved fertility in individuals with polycystic
ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (<a href="108">108</a>,<a href="109">109</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Manufacturers have cited early pregnancy losses and fetal
abnormalities in animal studies when exposed during organogenesis that
coincided with marked maternal body weight loss, leading to a
recommendation to stop using Semaglutide two months before pregnancy and
a recommendation against routine use of all GLP-1RAs during pregnancy.
Before discontinuation, it is also recommended to evaluate the risks and
benefits, incorporating the implications of hyperglycemia during
pregnancy (<a href="110">110-112</a>). The risk of fetal exposure on discontinuation
likely differs significantly among GLP-1RAs due to differences in
structure, pharmacokinetics, and potency. Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1RA
and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist and so
must be evaluated for risk independently from GLP-1RAs.</p>
<p class="text">Discontinuing GLP-1RAs has also been associated with rebound weight
gain in non-pregnant adults (<a href="113">113</a>,<a href="114">114</a>) and weight gain is expected with
transition to insulin. Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) has been
observed in those exposed to GLP-1RAs pre-pregnancy compared with those
who were not (<a href="115">115</a>). Another concern is the development of hyperglycemia
without appropriate glycemic management and risk of teratogenicity if
this occurs during the first trimester (<a href="116">116</a>). The impact of GLP-1RA
discontinuation earlier in the preconception period compared with the
start of pregnancy has an unknown impact on pregnancy outcomes.</p>
<p class="h2">Question 3</p>
<p class="text">Should discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist
(GLP-1RA) before pregnancy vs. GLP-1RA discontinuation between the start
of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester be used in individuals
with pre-existing type 2 diabetes?</p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 3 </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with type 2 diabetes, we suggest discontinuation of
GLP-1RA before conception rather than discontinuation between the start
of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester.  (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remarks</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Sudden discontinuation of GLP-1RA may cause hyperglycemia and
weight gain, which increases the risk for congenital malformations and
spontaneous abortion. Timely transition and titration of alternative
antihyperglycemic agents after discontinuing GLP-1 RAs is necessary to
minimize hyperglycemia. </p>
<p class="listlevel1">The timing of discontinuation prior to pregnancy should be
individualized based on the likelihood of conception after discontinuing
contraception, type of GLP-1 RA used, and risks of prolonged time off
GLP-1 RAs prior to pregnancy. </p>
<p class="listlevel1">Active management of glycemia is required after GLP-1 RA
discontinuation.  </p>
<p class="h2">Summary of Evidence</p>
<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a
href="https://guidelines.gradepro.org/staging/profiles/enkL3dLKogQ">https://guidelines.gradepro.org/profile/enkL3dLKogQ</a> </p>
<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review did not identify any RCT evaluating the effects
of the timing of GLP-1RA discontinuation on the outcomes of interest for
individuals with pre-existing T2DM. The GDP identified the following as
important outcomes related to discontinuing GLP-1RA in early
pregnancy:</p>

<p class="listlevel1">Congenital malformations</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Spontaneous abortion</p>
<p class="listlevel1">LGA infants</p>
<p class="listlevel1">SGA infants</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Maternal gestational weight gain</p>

<p class="text">The only comparative study identified (<a href="117">117</a>) provided indirect
evidence comparing exposure to GLP-1RA versus insulin alone based on
prescription fill history. The study population was limited to those
with live births, and a minority had pre-existing T2DM. The primary
outcome was to compare the risk of congenital anomalies between those
who stopped GLP-1RA in early pregnancy to the group with T2DM that
received insulin only. There was no difference in the rate of congenital
anomalies between groups. The rate of major congenital malformations in
infants born to mothers with T2DM was 5.3% and 8.3% in infants exposed
to GLP-1RA. Compared to insulin, the adjusted risk ratio for major
congenital malformations with GLP-1RA was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.72–1.26). The
study was limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis, lack of
information regarding glycemia in study participants, unclear data as to
whether the GLP-1RA was discontinued before organogenesis (5 weeks’
gestation) or after, maternal nutrition, GWG, and neonatal outcomes
including weight.</p>
<p class="text">There is no direct data relating to the risk of spontaneous abortion,
effect on fetal growth (LGA or SGA) or impact on GWG (either excessive
or inadequate). A systematic review of indirect data on GLP-1RA exposure
during pregnancy in animal offspring found an association with reduced
fetal weight and/or growth and delayed ossification and skeletal
variants (<a href="118">118</a>) typically associated with marked maternal weight loss.
Although GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the human placenta (<a href="119">119</a>),
available data shows minimal placental transfer of exendin-4 in mouse
models, ex vivo human placental experiments of liraglutide, and a case
study of human umbilical vein blood after liraglutide use to term (<a href="118">118</a>).
The impact of GLP-1RA s on placental GLP-1 receptor function is unknown.
These data resulted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not
approving routine GLP-1RA use during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">Another observational cohort study (<a href="120">120</a>) providing indirect evidence
evaluated exposure of GLP-1RA s for obesity and T2DM in early pregnancy
(27.4% of the study population) and reported no difference in congenital
anomalies, spontaneous abortions, or increased numbers of LGA or SGA
neonates compared with reference groups with T2DM and obesity without
GLP-1RA exposure. There was no information on GWG or glucose in this
study.</p>
<p class="text">Other indirect evidence examined the effect of shorter-acting GLP-1RA
s in women with infertility in the preconception period (<a href="121">121</a>) and (<a href="108">108</a>).
The GLP-1RA groups generally had either greater or no difference in
weight loss and a higher spontaneous pregnancy rate at 12 weeks after
stopping GLP-1RA s alone or combined with metformin. There were no
significant differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes between
groups.</p>
<p class="text">The FDA approval package for the weight-loss formulation of
liraglutide provided data from the manufacturer’s pharmacovigilance
database of 109 liraglutide-exposed pregnancies reporting an incidence
of 29.4% spontaneous abortions and 8.3% incidence of congenital
abnormalities, and six of the nine cases could not rule out liraglutide
exposure as a cause. The data from the manufacturer is difficult to
interpret without background information, such as whether any of the
individuals had PDM, and, if so, what their degree of glycemia was; what
the rates of obesity were in this population, as obesity is a risk
factor for congenital anomalies; and whether any of the individuals were
taking other medications associated with congenital anomalies. Further
research is needed to evaluate these findings.</p>
<p class="text">Seven case reports described exposure during pregnancy to a variety
of GLP-1RA. One reported mild bilateral pyelectasis (<a href="122">122</a>); another
reported atrial septal defect (<a href="123">123</a>). Other case reports (<a href="124">124-128</a>) did
not report congenital anomalies. Two case reports described increased
GWG when longer-acting GLP-1RA s were stopped in pregnancy (<a href="119">119</a>,<a href="124">124</a>,<a href="127">127</a>)
while others did not report on GWG. Of the case reports that reported
fetal weight, two showed increased fetal weight (<a href="124">124</a>,<a href="125">125</a>,<a href="127">127</a>), while one
did not (<a href="124">124</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In summary, there is no direct evidence comparing the intervention to
the control. All the reviewed studies addressing whether GLP-1RA s
should be discontinued before pregnancy or between the start of
pregnancy and the end of the first trimester in individuals with PDM
have limitations. These limitations include various study designs,
including individuals with and without pre-existing T2DM, use of GLP-1RA
s with differences in potency and half-lives, variable discontinuation
times in gestation, and concomitant use with other medications such as
metformin. There were differences in baseline socioeconomic and ethnic
study groups. The panel believed that the lack of information on level
of glycemia when GLP-1RA s were stopped in early gestation was a
significant limitation. The limited available evidence supports a likely
low risk in humans of congenital anomalies, most likely due to GLP-1RA s
being too large to cross the placenta. The indirect effects of GLP-1RA s
affecting placental function are not known. The risk of spontaneous
abortion does not appear to be increased in the infertility trials
(<a href="108">108</a>,<a href="121">121</a>). The case reports were not consistent on effects of GLP-1RAs
on GWG or altered fetal growth. However, the animal and
pharmacovigilance data are concerning, and further study is needed.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The most common fear in individuals using medication during pregnancy
is fetal harm (<a href="129">129</a>); therefore, the main outcomes of LGA and SGA
infants, congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, and GWG were
judged to have no important uncertainty or variability in value for
individuals</p>
<p class="text">The medication costs for the early switch to insulin from GLP-1RAs
are variable and difficult to determine due to pricing differences in
different countries. Additionally, costs will vary depending on the
patient’s dosing needs, whether both basal and bolus insulin are
required, and type of health care coverage. The switch to insulin will
require closer follow-up by a health care provider during the
transition, closer glucose monitoring, and potentially more frequent
injections requiring additional supplies. This transition will occur in
both the intervention and comparator, but the higher treatment
complexity may occur for a longer duration if GLP-1RAs are stopped
before pregnancy rather than the first trimester. However, the risk of
longer exposure to GLP-1RA s during pregnancy and the cost of potential
adverse pregnancy outcomes need to be considered. No cost-effective
studies were identified.</p>
<p class="text">There is no direct evidence evaluating the impact of the intervention
on health equity. The potential for higher treatment complexity for a
longer duration and the need for more frequent follow-up when converting
to insulin to provide adequate glycemic management may be a challenge
for those with health disparities in the pre-pregnancy period, whereas
they may qualify for additional resources once pregnant. Access to care
and additional resources varies; therefore, the GDP judged that the
impact of the intervention on health equity varies.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP judged that the acceptability of the intervention varies.
Discontinuation of GLP-1RA s before pregnancy is likely acceptable by
individuals if evidence shows this would minimize fetal harm (<a href="129">129</a>).
However, there is a lack of supporting data, and some may be hesitant to
discontinue GLP-1RA s pre-pregnancy due to rebound effects if they were
able to achieve significant weight loss and glycemic targets.
Additionally, acceptability and feasibility may be less if more complex
regimens are needed to replace GLP-1RAs.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP acknowledged challenges to the feasibility of the
intervention given low rates of pregnancy planning and PCC uptake. In
addition, GLP-1RAs are associated with improved fertility, which can
lead to unplanned pregnancies. Appropriate PCC and provider/patient
education can significantly improve the feasibility of the
intervention.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">The GDP did not find any direct evidence comparing GLP-1RA agonist
discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first
trimester in individuals with pre-existing T2DM. The only comparative
study identified (<a href="117">117</a>) was indirect evidence restricted to pregnancies
resulting from live births and exposure to GLP-1RAs based on filled
prescription history. A minority of the study population had
pre-existing T2DM and were exposed to GLP-1RA s, which was discontinued
in early pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the human placenta (<a href="119">119</a>); therefore,
although available data shows minimal placental transfer, the impact of
GLP-1RA s on the GLP-1 receptors in the placenta are unknown. The GDP
prioritized the uncertainty of the potential harms of the GLP-1RA s but
acknowledged the risks of hyperglycemia and weight gain with
discontinuation.</p>
<p class="text">Other factors that may impact outcomes of exposure to GLP-1RA during
pregnancy are the type of GLP-1RA used, trimester of exposure, maternal
phenotype, amount of weight loss achieved prior to conception, and
GWG.</p>
<p class="text">The timing of GLP-1RA discontinuation should balance the limited data
on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA during pregnancy and the potential for
nutrient deficiency and worsened nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
against the known risks of hyperglycemia and excessive weight gain which
may continue in the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. GLP-1RA
use is not recommended during pregnancy; however, many on therapy may be
planning for pregnancy. Contraception should be used while on GLP-1RA
rather than not using contraception and stopping GLP-1RA once pregnant.
The resources required and acceptability to discontinue GLP-1RA s while
minimizing hyperglycemia before pregnancy vary depending on maternal
characteristics and access to care. Although the GDP acknowledged
challenges to stopping GLP-1RA s before pregnancy, it is possible with
use of effective contraception during the period when pregnancy is not
desired and adequate preconception planning. A major consideration in
the GDP’s recommendation to stop GLP-1RA s before conception was to
afford the time needed to transition the patient to insulin and achieve
optimal glycemia before organogenesis rather than risk unknown
consequences of GLP-1RA exposure and hyperglycemia in the transitionary
period if stopped as soon as pregnancy is suspected. Ideally, stopping
GLP-1RA s and using contraception should be jointly decided on by the
patient and provider. When stopping GLP-1RA , optimizing glycemia with
insulin and maintaining a healthy diet are necessary. Although the
individual may desire pregnancy soon after stopping GLP-1RA s, achieving
and sustaining optimal glycemia and nutrition before conception not only
will decrease the risk of congenital anomalies but may help with healthy
GWG in pregnancy. Priority should be placed on ensuring effective
contraception or adequate preconception planning to effectively stop
GLP-1RA s before pregnancy since their effects in pregnancy are
unknown.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">In the absence of direct evidence supporting the safety of continued
use during pregnancy, the GDP recommended discontinuing GLP-1RA s before
pregnancy. The preconception use of GLP-1RA s in women with obesity to
decrease excessive weight before pregnancy to reduce adverse perinatal
complications of pregnancy such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
and fetal overgrowth are important goals. Decreasing weight and
improving the metabolic condition of women with obesity is being
assessed currently using the lifestyle interventions of healthy diet and
increased physical activity (<a href="130">130</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The manufacturer prescribing recommendations for some GLP-1RAs
suggest stopping therapy before conception due to early pregnancy losses
and fetal abnormalities in animal studies when exposed during
organogenesis that coincided with marked maternal body weight loss. Yet,
this approach has risk for harm if no proactive attention to glycemic
management is in place or discontinuation occurs in the absence of
active pregnancy plans. Effective coordination of care in both the
preconception period and early pregnancy is needed with discontinuation
of GLP-1RA s, and glucose should be immediately and actively
monitored.</p>
<p class="text">Although the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the United
States declined from 43.3% in 2010 to 41.6% in 2019, approximately 40%
remain unintended (<a href="131">131</a>). Women of childbearing age on GLP-1RA s who are
not planning pregnancy, even with a history of infertility, should use
effective contraception to minimize unplanned pregnancies. A recent
literature review addresses the variable impact of GLP-1RA s on the
efficacy of oral contraceptives (<a href="54">54</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Requirements to improve implementation of the recommendation include
effective education of clinicians, diligent counseling and surveillance
of individuals of childbearing age, and access to PCC.</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The increasing use of GLP-1RA s in T2DM emphasizes the need for
further research related to use in the preconception period and exposure
during pregnancy, and close post-marketing surveillance and registry
data collection for analysis is encouraged. Proposed areas for future
research include:</p>

<p class="h1">Metformin and Insulin vs. Insulin </p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Although a number of evidence-based guidelines recommend insulin as
the preferred anti-diabetic medication in pregnancy (<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="132">132</a>), rates of
metformin use in pregnancies complicated by T2DM have been steadily
increasing (<a href="133">133</a>). Metformin may improve hepatic insulin resistance,
decrease insulin requirements, reduce GWG, and decrease the risk of LGA.
Results of systematic reviews in individuals with GDM comparing
metformin to insulin have been mixed, with some showing a lower risk of
LGA , preeclampsia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and less GWG, while others do
not (<a href="134">134</a>,<a href="135">135</a>). Metformin in GDM also tends to be more acceptable for
individuals and clinicians as an alternative to insulin due to its low
cost, oral route, ease of administration, and low risk for hypoglycemia.
However, individuals with T2DM in pregnancy have more severe insulin
deficiency and more severe insulin resistance and typically require
insulin to achieve optimal glycemia, so metformin is not a substitute
for insulin in T2DM as it can be in GDM (<a href="136">136</a>). Concerns for metformin
use in pregnancy are primarily due to the risk of fetal growth
restriction in some individuals and long-term fetal programming
potential for childhood obesity with increased fat mass reported in some
childhood cohorts but not others (<a href="137">137-141</a>). Unlike insulin, metformin
has been found to exhibit marked maternal to fetal transfer, achieving
fetal levels at least as high as maternal levels due to high expression
of OCT3 cation transporters in the placenta in the second and third
trimesters (<a href="142">142</a>). Metformin is concentrated in both fetal and placental
mitochondria 1,000-fold. Metformin has pleiotropic effects, including
activating AMP kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting mitochondrial complex 1
respiration, and has anti-proliferative and nutrient restriction
properties through AMPK and decreased mTOR (<a href="136">136</a>,<a href="143">143</a>,<a href="144">144</a>). Notably, it
crosses the placenta poorly in the first trimester and does not increase
the risk of major malformations (<a href="136">136</a>,<a href="145">145</a>). Pathophysiologic studies
providing plausible mechanistic data as to how the properties of
metformin might result in fetal effects have been recently published in
monkeys who share similarities in placental structure with humans.
Metformin given maternally at doses that achieve equivalent levels in
humans resulted in decreased fetal weight and skeletal muscle mass and
bioaccumulated in the fetal kidney and liver (<a href="143">143</a>). Considering the
increasing prevalence of metformin use during pregnancy, the need for
insulin therapy in most people with pre-existing T2D, and the concerns
of intrauterine metformin exposure to the fetus, the GDP prioritized
evaluation of metformin added to insulin compared to insulin alone in
pre-existing T2D.</p>

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review identified two RCTs addressing the effect of
adding metformin to insulin therapy versus continuing insulin only
during pregnancies complicated by T2DM (<a href="146">146</a>,<a href="147">147</a>). The five important
patient outcomes determined critical for decision-making included:</p>

<p class="listlevel3">LGA infants</p>
<p class="listlevel3">SGA infants</p>
<p class="listlevel3">NICU admission</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Preeclampsia</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Offspring overweight (BMI &ge;85th percentile; extracted estimate is
for BMI Z score for risk of overweight [&ge;1 SD using WHO reference] at
0–18 years)</p>

<p class="text">The meta-analysis performed for this guideline included 2 RCTs:
Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy (MiTY) and
Metformin Plus Insulin for Preexisting Diabetes of Gestational Diabetes
in Early Pregnancy (MOMPODS). It revealed a decreased risk of LGA in the
group of insulin plus metformin (RR, 0.74 [0.62–0.89]); the effect for
the other four short-term outcomes of interest did not reach statistical
significance, including SGA (RR, 1.43 [0.98–2.10]).</p>
<p class="text">The rate of LGA was decreased in both the MiTY RCT (25 Centers in
Canada and 4 in Australia) and the MOMPOD RCT (17 centers in the United
States). However, in the MOMPOD RCT, it is unclear whether similar
degrees of glycemia were achieved (the major driver of fetal overgrowth)
because only 39% of participants had HbA1C levels available at term to
ascertain if glycemia was similar. Only the MiTY RCT (not the MOMPOD
RCT) showed an increase in SGA (13% in the metformin group vs. 7% in the
placebo group; r = 1.96 [1.1–3.64]). Notably, the MOMPOD RCT was stopped
at 75% for not yielding a difference in the composite outcome, so it was
not powered to evaluate the rate of SGA alone. The primary composite
outcomes were not statistically different in either of the RCTs, and the
GDP’s patient-important outcomes of NICU admissions and
preeclampsia/hypertensive disorders in pregnancy were not different.
Notably, the enrollment in MOMPOD in the U.S. included a population that
was 80% Black or Hispanic compared to the population in the MiTY RCT
that was predominantly European, Non-European, and Asian with only 2.5%
Hispanic and 15% African or Caribbean which might affect baseline risk
for outcomes and interpretation of results. Although not included in the
panel’s five patient-important outcomes, GWG and insulin requirements
were statistically significantly decreased in MiTY but not MOMPOD.</p>
<p class="text">A reduction in the rate of LGA could be a benefit and possibly
translate to a decreased risk of obesity in childhood and reduced
cesarean deliveries, but there is no evidence that metformin decreased
primary cesarean deliveries. Although a decrease in the rate of LGA is a
favorable outcome, the effect of metformin on body composition (lean
mass vs. fat mass) is likely more important, which is unknown in the
human offspring in T2DM. If metformin decreases skeletal muscle mass in
humans, as was demonstrated in the monkey fetuses exposed to similar
levels of metformin in utero as humans would be (<a href="143">143</a>), this could result
in a decrease in LGA through a decrease in lean mass, which is
associated with the subsequent development of metabolic disease and
obesity. An increase in SGA, seen in MiTY but not MOMPOD, would be
undesirable given its association with more long-term adverse outcomes,
especially if it is a result of reduced lean muscle mass as in the data
from monkeys. Having SGA status, like LGA status, is also a risk factor
for childhood obesity, especially when the offspring is exposed later in
life to an obesogenic postnatal environment (<a href="148">148</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The GDP strongly weighted RCTs, rather than observational trials or
retrospective studies. A recently published retrospective study often
cited using health care claims data, compared individuals with
pre-existing T2D who continued metformin with those who discontinued
metformin during the second trimester. It found no differences in the
adjusted relative risk of perinatal outcomes including LGA ,
preeclampsia, and NICU admissions. Of note, SGA results were divided by
cohort due to heterogeneity, and the commercially insured cohort found a
higher risk for SGA infants in the metformin group (aRR, 1.99; 95% CI:
1.1–3.62), while the publicly insured cohort did not (aRR, 0.8: 95% CI:
0.48–1.33) Prescription bias and residual confounders affecting those
who continued metformin versus those who did not may account for these
inconsistent results.</p>
<p class="text">The only follow-up trial of offspring overweight/obesity with
maternal T2DM randomized to metformin plus insulin versus insulin alone
is the MiTY Kids study, but it was limited to offspring growth at ages 6
to 24 months (<a href="149">149</a>). It found no difference in the BMI Z score at 24
months but an increase in the growth trajectory of males ages 6 to 24
months. Developmental programming of metabolic disease suggests that
males may be more affected than females and that age 2 years is likely
not long enough to see differences in offspring weight or body
composition that predict future obesity risk (<a href="148">148</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The only RCTs that followed the offspring to evaluate the risk of
childhood overweight/obesity at 5 to 10 years were in pregnant women
given metformin versus no treatment for GDM or PCOS, not in pregnancies
complicated by T2DM in which the mothers were also taking insulin. An
increased tendency to overweight/obesity has been observed in children
ages 5 to 10 years whose mothers were treated with metformin in two
studies: the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes: the Offspring Follow-Up
(MiG TOFU) and the Intrauterine Metformin Exposure and Offspring
Cardiometabolic Risk factors (PedMet) study in women with PCOS
(<a href="139">139</a>,<a href="141">141</a>). In the MiG TOFU follow-up of the offspring in the MiG RCT
(<a href="141">141</a>), the Auckland cohort but not the Adelaide cohort demonstrated
increased weight at ages 7 to 9 years. An increase in children
overweight at 5 to 10 years was also seen in the PedMet study. No
increase in overweight/obesity was demonstrated in a third study that
followed two cohorts in Finland whose mothers were randomized to
metformin versus insulin for GDM (<a href="140">140</a>). A recent meta-analysis of the
Rowan and Paavilainen RCTs (<a href="140">140</a>,<a href="141">141</a>,<a href="150">150</a>) concluded no difference in
offspring weight at 9 years but excluded the PedMet RCT of pregnancies
complicated by PCOS (<a href="139">139</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Although indirect in evidence and not established in human studies, a
recent small RCT randomizing human dose equivalents of metformin to
pregnant Rhesus monkeys (who share many anatomical, physiologic,
placental, and genomic similarities to humans) versus control, assessed
fetal organs and tissues by sacrificing the fetal monkeys at the
equivalent gestation of the human third trimester (<a href="143">143</a>). The fetal
monkeys demonstrated growth restriction primarily in skeletal muscle and
exhibited renal dysmorphology (<a href="143">143</a>). Initiation of metformin in early
pregnancy resulted in fetal bioaccumulation, growth restriction, and
renal dysmorphology in this primate model. These findings of decreased
lean mass in fetal monkeys could, in part, explain the SGA offspring
exposed to metformin in utero as well as the increased risk of childhood
overweight/obesity seen in some, but not all, follow-up offspring
studies. Additionally, in animal models, untoward effects of metformin
use during pregnancy were seen beyond early adulthood, underscoring the
need of long-term follow-up studies in humans to be certain about
potential programming effects (<a href="151">151</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The most common fear in individuals using medication during pregnancy
is fetal harm (<a href="129">129</a>); therefore, the main outcomes of LGA and SGA, NICU
admissions, preeclampsia, and offspring overweight were judged to have
no important uncertainty or variability in value for individuals.
Reduced GWG, also valued by individuals, occurred in the MiTY RCT but
not in the MOMPOD RCT. Notably, the majority of patients enrolled in
each trial were categorized as obese at randomization.</p>
<p class="text">The resources required to add metformin to insulin are low, with
modest wholesale prices in the United States and Europe. Most clinicians
are comfortable prescribing metformin, and, if metformin could
substantially decrease the amount of insulin required, including a
decrease in injection frequency, it could decrease resource utilization.
In the RCTs included in the systematic review, total insulin dose
requirements were decreased in the metformin plus insulin group compared
with the insulin alone group in the MiTY trial (1.1 ± 1.0 vs. 1.5 ± 1.1
units/kg; <span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.0001) but were similar in the MOMPOD trial
(0.9 ± 0.61 vs. 1.11 ± 3.1 units/kg). Based on the data available, the
cost savings in the metformin plus insulin vs. the insulin alone group
were judged to be low by the GDP since metformin alone is rarely
adequate for to attain glycemic targets in T2DM, and, although it may
reduce total insulin dose, it may not reduce the frequency and number of
insulin injections. Formal cost-effectiveness studies in a population
with T2DM were not found. In addition to the costs of therapy and
follow-up in the intervention group, the long-term impact on the
potential adverse outcomes in offspring, including epigenetic effects,
and the associated costs are unclear (<a href="136">136</a>,<a href="143">143</a>,<a href="152">152</a>).</p>
<p class="text">No equity studies were identified, but the lower cost and high
accessibility of metformin could improve or worsen health equity,
depending on the long-term outcomes in the offspring.</p>
<p class="text">The addition of metformin to insulin is likely to be acceptable to
most, if the patient does not have gastrointestinal adverse effects,
when considering cost and the potential for less GWG. In a systematic
review evaluating beliefs about medicines among pregnant women, it was
found that women tend to be more reluctant to use medicines during
pregnancy, which may limit the acceptability of the addition of
metformin to insulin. In the same systematic review, the most common
fear of medication use was the “risk of harm to the unborn child” (<a href="129">129</a>).
Therefore, many mothers may have concern over the high concentration of
metformin in fetal and placental tissues in the second and third
trimesters as well as the unknown long-term metabolic health risk in the
offspring.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation </p>
<p class="text">The GDP judged that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to
achieve a decrease in rates of LGA alone did not outweigh the potential
harm of increasing the risk of SGA or adverse childhood outcomes related
to changes in body composition, supported by indirect evidence. Although
the meta-analysis demonstrated a modest decrease in LGA (RR, 0.74
[0.62–0.89]), the GDP weighted the consideration of potential harm to
the offspring more heavily given that it is a major concern for
individuals and clinicians (<a href="129">129</a>) and that metformin would not be able to
replace insulin use in the vast majority of pregnant individuals with
T2DM. These concerns for harm were based on the limited data that the
rate of SGA was increased in the MiTY RCT, that metformin has high
maternal-to-fetal placental transfer in the second and third trimesters,
the indirect data suggesting the potential adverse impact on skeletal
muscle and kidney development in a non-human primate model, and that
some offspring exposed from GDM and PCOS pregnancies appeared to have an
increased risk of overweight at ages 5 to 10 years
(<a href="139">139</a>,<a href="141">141</a>,<a href="143">143</a>,<a href="144">144</a>,<a href="148">148</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Given these concerns and the absence of long-term offspring data in
T2DM pregnancies, the GDP recommends against the routine addition of
metformin to insulin treatment in individuals with pre-existing T2DM.
The small benefit of a decrease in rates of LGA in the meta-analysis did
not result in a decrease in primary cesarean deliveries and was not
considered to outweigh the potential long-term risks, especially given
the lack of reduction in preeclampsia, SGA, or NICU admissions, which
were the other major outcomes of interest. In addition, the intervention
was judged to have limited impact on patient burden or cost for most
individuals, as most individuals with T2DM, unlike GDM, would likely
require similar insulin dosing frequency, with possibly some reduction
in total insulin dosing, which was not consistent between the two
RCTs.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">The panel recognizes the potential for cost-savings in adding
metformin to insulin or in reducing the total insulin dose required or
gestational weight gain (seen in the MiTY but not the MOMPOD RCTs),
especially in resource-constrained settings, in subgroups in which
effective basal/bolus therapy with insulin may be difficult to achieve
using insulin alone, and those with extreme insulin resistance, at very
high risk for LGA and excess GWG. Notably, some subgroups with mild T2DM
may respond well to metformin and require little insulin, although most
patients with T2DM also require insulin to attain glycemic targets.
Additionally, those unwilling to inject multiple doses of insulin or who
have psychosocial, financial, access, or other barriers that preclude
the safe and effective use of insulin may benefit from metformin. In
these individuals, metformin could be considered, especially if cost
savings are appreciable and patient preference is strong, to minimize
the frequency or dosing required of insulin injections. When discussing
metformin with individuals in these subgroups, a comprehensive
discussion of potential risks and benefits of metformin is necessary to
allow the patient to make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="text">In the MiTy RCT, the group for whom metformin exposure in pregnancy
was most likely to result in SGA and should be avoided were pregnant
individuals with chronic hypertension and/or nephropathy who are at risk
for fetal growth restriction (<a href="153">153</a>). This group also has one of the
highest risks of preeclampsia. Given that metformin was not shown to
decrease preeclampsia but was associated with SGA in the MiTy RCT,
especially in this subgroup, metformin in individuals with chronic
hypertension or nephropathy is likely to pose higher risks than
benefits.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP prioritized the question of whether metformin should be added
to insulin in patients with pre-existing T2DM. However, metformin is
commonly used in T2DM outside of pregnancy, so there are multiple
clinical situations in which addition or discontinuation of metformin,
either pre-conception or prenatally, might be relevant but that were not
directly addressed by our literature review or GDP deliberations.</p>
<p class="text">The large RCTs (MiTY and MOMPOD) did not address the question of
continuing metformin in patients with T2DM already on it and adding
insulin given that all patients in MiTY and MOMPOD were only on insulin
at enrollment. The GDP did identify a RCT with a limited sample size
which included patients with T2DM for &lt;5 years or who had a new
diagnosis of T2DM and who were not on insulin. These patients with
“mild” T2DM were randomized to metformin versus insulin. The majority
(85%) failed metformin alone during pregnancy and insulin had to be
added (<a href="154">154</a>). Therefore, the analysis focused on comparing those
randomized to metformin in which insulin was added (n=90) compared to
randomized to insulin alone (n=100). In this single RCT with a limited
sample size, the group who failed metformin in which insulin was added
compared to the group on insulin alone demonstrated less insulin
requirements but no difference in gestational weight gain or LGA between
groups. However, there was an increase in SGA in the metformin + insulin
(14.4%) versus insulin alone (2%) group (p&lt;0.01).</p>
<p class="text">There is substantial safety date for metformin in the first trimester
due to poor placental crossing from a lack of cation transporters in the
first trimester.  Therefore, for those already on metformin, it could be
safely stopped at the end of the first trimester after organogenesis is
completed to avoid sudden withdrawal and the risk of
hyperglycemia-induced malformations. </p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The increasing use of metformin warrants further research to define
the risks and benefits of adding this therapy to insulin in individuals
with pre-existing T2DM. Proposed areas for future research include:</p>

<p class="listlevel1">Identifying subgroups that would particularly benefit from the
use of metformin (e.g., those at lower risk for fetal growth
restriction, those who have low insulin requirements, etc.)</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Identifying the subgroups at the highest risk of fetal growth
restriction from metformin (e.g., those with chronic hypertension,
nephropathy, a history of preeclampsia, obstructive sleep apnes (OSA),
or evidence of microvascular or macrovascular disease, which increase
the risk of placental insufficiency)</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Evaluating the effect of maternal metformin use on newborn
subcutaneous and visceral fat and lean mass (e.g., by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry [DXA], air-displacement plethysmography, 3D ultrasound,
or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Designing and executing rigorous long-term follow-up studies of
offspring at 5 years to adulthood who were exposed to metformin in utero
that include outcomes such as body composition; lean tissue and
subcutaneous and visceral fat measures; renal, vascular, and cardiac
function; indices of metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction; and
neurocognitive outcomes, considering duration and intensity of
exposure</p>
<p class="listlevel1">As noted, metformin is commonly used in patients with T2DM
outside of pregnancy. Its addition or discontinuation may be relevant in
various clinical scenarios, and the potential harms and benefits of
different approaches should be evaluated through formal RCTs and
systematic literature reviews to inform clinical practice
recommendations.</p>
<p class="h1">Carbohydrate-restricted Diet</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Carbohydrates are the main macronutrient that determine postprandial
hyperglycemia, and the amount as well as the type of carbohydrate in the
meal plan influence the glycemic response in individuals with diabetes
(<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="155">155</a>,<a href="156">156</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that low-carbohydrate
diets may improve glycemia (including TIR, time below range [TBR], and
glycemic variability), reduce weight and insulin dose, and lower the
risk of severe hypoglycemia in nonpregnant individuals with T1DM
(<a href="157">157</a>,<a href="158">158</a>), while short-term benefits on glycemia and adiposity and
long-term benefits on dyslipidemia were reported for non-pregnant
individuals with T2DM (<a href="159">159</a>,<a href="160">160</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In contrast, the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) nutrition guidelines
recommend that pregnant women supplement their daily intake for at least
a total of 175 grams of carbohydrates to promote fetal growth and brain
development (<a href="161">161-163</a>), and some experts suggest an even higher
recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 220 grams to account for the
estimated 35 grams of carbohydrate required by the placenta in the third
trimester (<a href="162">162</a>).</p>
<p class="text">It should be noted that the IOM RDA is an overestimation of the true
requirement, as 97.5% of the population requires less (<a href="162">162</a>) and it
ignores the possibility that some glucose may come from gluconeogenesis
(with a maximum capacity of 160–180 g during starvation)
(<a href="162">162</a>,<a href="164">164</a>,<a href="165">165</a>).</p>
<p class="text">While insufficient calorie and carbohydrate intake leads to
moderately increased levels of ketone bodies in nonpregnant and pregnant
women without diabetes (<a href="166">166</a>,<a href="167">167</a>), as well as in women with PDM
(<a href="132">132</a>,<a href="161">161</a>,<a href="168">168</a>), these abnormalities are associated with acidosis only in
extreme circumstances (<a href="169">169</a>). Furthermore, with adequate calorie intake,
the amount of carbohydrate intake (in the range of 100–250 g) is
unrelated to ketone levels in pregnant women with obesity (<a href="170">170</a>),
although calorie and carbohydrate requirements are not constant
throughout pregnancy and are likely to reach the highest level in the
last trimester of pregnancy, with fetal and placental energy demands
(<a href="171">171</a>). However, a weak correlation (r, 0.2–0.3) between increased levels
of maternal ketone bodies and the offspring’s mental development at age
2 years have been described (<a href="155">155</a>,<a href="172">172</a>) and extreme carbohydrate
restriction (&lt;95 g/day) during pregnancy is associated with a 20% to
100% increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) (<a href="173">173-175</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Dieting has become more prevalent in the United States in the last
two decades. Altogether, approximately 40% of the adult population is
performing some weight loss effort (mostly dieting) according to
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data,
including 39% of women who are non-obese and 33% of women with obesity
who restrict their carbohydrate intake (<a href="176">176</a>).</p>
<p class="text">According to a narrative review and observational data, pregnant
women with PDM consume 200 to 250 grams of carbohydrate daily (~50 g
more than controls), indicating that up to a third of women could
consume less than the recommended 175 grams (<a href="156">156</a>,<a href="177">177-180</a>). A
Scandinavian study reported even lower intakes during pregnancy (159 g
in T1DM and 167 g in T2DM), which translates to 40% to 50% of
individuals with less carbohydrate intake than the IOM recommendation
(<a href="181">181</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The increasing proportion of non-pregnant and pregnant women
following carbohydrate-reduced diets and the theoretical considerations
of the associated potential harms make it essential to clarify adequate
carbohydrate intake in women with PDM. Thus, the GDP judged this
question to be a priority because medical nutrition therapy is one of
the cornerstones of effective diabetes management.</p>
<p class="h2">Question 5 </p>
<p class="text">Should a carbohydrate restricted (&lt;175 g per day) diet vs. usual

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review did not identify any RCTs evaluating the effect
of carbohydrate-restricted (&lt;175 g/day) vs. usual (&gt;175 g/day)
diets during pregnancy in individuals with PDM on the risk of the
selected outcomes:</p>
<p class="listlevel3">LGA</p>

<p class="listlevel3">Neonatal hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Developmental delay up to age 18 years</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Offspring overweight (BMI &ge;85th percentile) up to age 18 years</p>

<p class="text">The only indirect evidence on PDM came from a secondary analysis of
the DAPIT RCT and suggested that a carbohydrate intake above 191 g/day
was associated with doubling the risk of hyperglcyemia (HbA1C &ge;6.5%)
after adjustment for maternal age, diabetes duration, and BMI among
women with T1DM (<a href="182">182</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Most evidence on carbohydrate-reduced diets derives from studies
performed among women with GDM or obesity. The RECORD trial randomized
women with obesity and less than 20 weeks’ gestation to either a
low-carbohydrate diet (130–150 g/day) or usual care. While no
significant difference in SGA and LGA and neonatal hypoglycemia were
found, the study was not powered for these outcomes. Potentially
favorable effects were found on glycemia, GWG, and blood pressure,
although the carbohydrate intake of the intervention arm remained far
above the intended amount at about 190 g/day (95% CI: 163–216 g/day)
(<a href="183">183</a>). Similarly, RCTs that compared modestly lower carbohydrate intake
to usual care in GDM reported no difference in the outcomes (rate of
LGA, SGA, neonatal hypoglycemia as well as birthweight, newborn fat mass
and fat-free mass, maternal hypertension, cesarean delivery, percent fat
mass, fat-free mass, and maternal ketone levels), suggesting no harmful
effects, at least during pregnancy and delivery. The achieved
carbohydrate intakes were higher than aimed for, but the mean intake
still remained below or around the 175-gram cutoff (165–177 g). This is
further supported by a systematic review and a meta-analysis including
two studies that found no harmful effect of the low-carbohydrate diet
(aiming for 40%–45% vs. 55%–60% of energy intake from carbohydrates) on
different pregnancy outcomes (LGA and SGA, glycemia, insulin
requirement, birthweight, cesarean deliveries, perinatal mortality, and
maternal hypertension) in GDM (<a href="184">184</a>,<a href="185">185</a>).</p>
<p class="text">We identified indirect evidence from observational studies that
severe carbohydrate restriction during pregnancy (lowest 5th percentile
of carbohydrate intake corresponding to &lt;95 g/day) is associated with
a 20% to 100% increased risk of NTDs in the general population
(<a href="173">173-175</a>). Furthermore, the popular high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
(&lt;100 g) is nutritionally inadequate and required vitamin and other
micronutrient supplementation according to a systematic review
(<a href="186">186</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Altogether, indirect evidence coming from studies in women with
obesity and GDM provided no evidence of any harmful effect of moderate
restriction of carbohydrate intake (&gt;130 g/day) on LGA,SGA,neonatal
hypoglycemia, as well as birthweight and perinatal mortality and
maternal glycemia, weight gain, hypertension, ketonuria, cesarean
delivery, and insulin requirement (<a href="183">183-185</a>,<a href="187">187</a>,<a href="188">188</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Given that we found no direct evidence in PDM on our prespecified
outcomes, the certainty of evidence is very low. The only indirect
evidence in PDM is suggesting better glcyemia with meal plans with fewer
than 191 g/day of carbohydrates (<a href="182">182</a>). Given that maternal glycemia is
the most important predictor of pregnancy outcomes in PDM, any
beneficial effect of carbohydrate restriction on glycemia could be of
utmost importance (<a href="161">161</a>,<a href="189">189</a>).</p>
<p class="text">We found indirect evidence of a neutral effect of low carbohydrate
diets on SGA and LGA and neonatal hypoglycemia in GDM but no evidence
(not even indirect) on the other selected outcomes
(<a href="184">184</a>,<a href="185">185</a>,<a href="187">187</a>,<a href="188">188</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Research findings suggest that severe restriction of carbohydrate
intake (&lt;100 g/day) during pregnancy is associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes (<a href="173">173-175</a>,<a href="186">186</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The GDP judged there was consistent high value of the selected
outcomes to individuals.</p>
<p class="text">According to a small observational study, the cost of the actual diet
of pregnant women with diabetes (T1D, T2DM, and GDM) was like that of a
recommended diet based on computer simulation, suggesting that the
quality of the diet can be improved without further financial strain on
the pregnant women (<a href="177">177</a>). Therefore, the group judged that the cost of
the intervention is negligible. Limited indirect data demonstrated
variable acceptability and feasibility (<a href="6">6</a>,<a href="183">183</a>,<a href="184">184</a>,<a href="186">186</a>,<a href="187">187</a>,<a href="190">190</a>).</p>
<p class="text">No formal evaluation of cost-effectiveness was identified.</p>
<p class="text">In general, there is low adherence to dietary guidelines, but
adherence is better in women with higher education, older age, and
non-smoking status (<a href="190">190</a>). Furthermore, obese women highlighted that
competing priorities could be a significant barrier to following a low
carbohydrate diet that probably would increase inequities among pregnant
women (<a href="183">183</a>). Thus, equity could be a problem with the proposed
intervention as not all people will have the same ability to implement
the recommendation.</p>
<p class="text">According to a randomized trial among obese pregnant women, an
intervention aiming at a low carbohydrate intake (130-150g/day) was well
accepted by the mothers. However, some participants found the diet
challenging, especially at later stages of pregnancy (<a href="183">183</a>).</p>
<p class="text">None of the articles reviewed investigated the actual feasibility of
a low carbohydrate diet during pregnancy in individuals with PDM.
Adherence of low carbohydrate diets was low in GDM (<a href="6">6</a>). According to
randomized trials among obese pregnant and GDM women, the carbohydrate
reduction achieved in the intervention group was limited and remained
far below the intended aim (140 vs 190 g of carbohydrate/day) and only
~20% met their target intake that suggests a limited achievability of a
diet with limited carbohydrate (<a href="183">183</a>,<a href="187">187</a>). While participation may be
high in dietary education, studies performed among GDM women suggest
that adherence to low carbohydrate diets are generally poor, and
targeted intakes are rarely achieved and even the level of adherence
varies by different patient characteristics including socioeconomic
status.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">The GDP did not identify any direct evidence evaluating the effects
of a carbohydrate-restricted diet in people with PDM. Indirect evidence
in women with PDM suggests some glycemic benefit with carbohydrate
intake less than 191 g/day. All other indirect evidence focused on GDM
and women with obesity. Additionally, these studies used different
definitions of low-carbohydrate diets that either emphasized the
proportion of energy from carbohydrates of the total energy intake or
used different cut-off values of daily intake. There were mostly neutral
findings on LGA and SGA and neonatal hypoglycemia as well as newborn fat
mass and fat-free mass. Data on other outcomes (glucose, weight gain,
and blood pressure) suggest some benefit of carbohydrate restriction in
pregnant women with obesity, while most outcomes (including LGA and SGA)
were similar in the intervention and control groups in GDM. In addition,
there was some indirect evidence from the general population of an
increased risk of NTDs among pregnant women in the lowest fifth
percentile of carbohydrate intake (&lt;100 g/day).</p>
<p class="text">The GDP judged this evidence to be too indirect, leading to
significant uncertainty regarding the net benefits or harms and limited
to support a recommendation in favor of or against a cutoff of 175 g/day
carbohydrate intake. The GDP felt that the optimal carbohydrate intake
probably reflects a wider range that includes the current cut-off value,
but the lower and upper limits are not clearly defined in existing
studies. It seems clear that both the lower and upper extremes are
harmful for both mother and child. Moreover, pregnancy carbohydrate
requirements may be impacted by such individualized factors as maternal
size, gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy BMI, type of PDM, presence
of coexisting health conditions, dietary patterns and food choices prior
to conception, changing nutritional needs as the pregnancy progresses,
and other factors.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Similarly to overall energy requirements, nutritional status (such as
the presence or absence of obesity) may impact the total daily
carbohydrate requirement of women with PDM (<a href="183">183</a>). Furthermore, the type
of diabetes may require the modification of daily carbohydrate
requirement when factoring in differences in insulin resistance and
insulin secretion. Social factors (including socioeconomic status, level
of education, and health literacy) may affect access to high-quality
food sources and available carbohydrate sources (<a href="70">70</a>,<a href="190">190</a>). These factors
could modify both the required amount of carbohydrate as well as the
acceptability of the recommended dietary intervention.</p>
<p class="text">While participation may be high in dietary education, studies
performed in women with GDM suggest that adherence to low-carbohydrate
diets is generally poor, and targeted intake is rarely achieved; even
the level of adherence varies by individual characteristics including
socioeconomic status and cultural beliefs (<a href="183">183</a>,<a href="187">187</a>). Implementation
should consider dietary patterns depending on geographical region,
social attitudes, and migration status (<a href="66">66</a>). Additionally, food
choices and maternal eating patterns are often influenced by food
preferences of the whole family, and high-quality food is often more
expensive than processed snack foods and fast food (<a href="191">191</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Proposed areas for future research include answering the following
questions:</p>

<p class="listlevel1">What is the lowest and highest daily amount of carbohydrate and
energy intake that can be safely consumed to maintain optimal glycemia
and pregnancy outcomes for women with PDM?</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Does the optimal daily amount of carbohydrate and energy intake
differ based on the type of diabetes or BMI for women with PDM?</p>
<p class="listlevel1">What is the lowest and highest daily amount of carbohydrate and
energy intake that can be safely consumed to optimize long-term outcomes
of the offspring of women with PDM?</p>
<p class="listlevel1">What is the impact of the quality of carbohydrates in the meal
plan on glucose management in women with PDM?</p>
<p class="listlevel1">What is the required daily intake of carbohydrates in the first,
second, and third trimesters for women with PDM?</p>
<p class="h1">Continuous Glucose Monitoring vs. Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose in Individuals with pre-existing T2DM</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">The prevalence of T2DM is now higher than T1DM in many obstetric
populations, continues to rise rapidly, and has more than tripled in the
last 10 years in some populations (<a href="192">192</a>). Some adverse pregnancy
outcomes, including stillbirths, cesarean deliveries, LGA, and NICU
admissions, are higher in individuals with T2DM than in those with T1DM
due to greater prevalence of comorbidities, including obesity,
hypertension, renal disease, and OSA. As a result, improving pregnancy
outcomes in T2DM may require optimizing numerous factors in addition to
improving the degree of glycemia and may require a different targets for
glycemia compared with T1DM (<a href="20">20</a>,<a href="193">193-199</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Frequent glucose monitoring is critical in T2DM in pregnancy to
appropriately modify treatment regimens with the increasing insulin
resistance of pregnancy. Although CGM use in Type 1 DM is considered
standard of care (<a href="200">200</a>), the current standard in T2DM is SMBG (fasting
and either 1 or 2 hours postprandial). Ease of use and increasing access
to CGM technology means that more individuals with T2DM are interested
in using CGM during pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
recommends that CGM in pregnancy should be combined with SMBG to achieve
optimal pre- and postprandial targets (<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="201">201</a>). If CGM is not used, the
standard of care is to continue SMBG four times daily.</p>
<p class="h2">Question 6</p>
<p class="text">Should a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) vs. no CGM (self-monitoring
blood glucose [SMBG] as standard of care) be used in pregnant
individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)?</p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 6</p>
<p class="text">In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we
suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of
blood glucose (SMBG). (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remarks</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives for
monitoring glucose during pregnancy, however, in individuals with T2DM,
there is limited direct evidence for this. CGM may offer a potential
advantage vs. SBGM in certain subgroups of preexisting Type 2
diabetes.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % Time in Range (TIR) for
individuals for T2DM may be different compared to those which have
demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.</p>

<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The five important patient outcomes determined to be critical for
decision-making included:</p>
<p class="listlevel1">LGA</p>
<p class="listlevel1">SGA</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Neonatal hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Admission to the NICU</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Glucometrics (TIR, time above range [TAR], and time below range
[TBR])</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review identified three RCTs in pregnant individuals
with T2DM, T1DM, or GDM randomized to management with CGM or without
CGM. The fewest number of individuals included had T2DM (<a href="202">202-204</a>). None
of the identified studies enrolled only individuals with T2DM, and one
of the three studies did not analyze individuals with T2DM separately
(<a href="205">205</a>). Moreover, CGM was not used continuously in the trials that
analyzed T2DM separately, one using real-time CGM (rtCGM) technology for
only limited periods and the other using blinded CGM for only limited
periods (<a href="204">204</a>,<a href="206">206</a>). The current rtCGM technology commonly used on a
continual basis was not used in any of the three RCTs.</p>
<p class="text">Therefore, direct evidence is limited to two RCTs comparing limited
CGM use in addition to SMBG versus SMBG that included a small number of
individuals with T2DM in pregnancy that could be analyzed separately
from individuals with T1DM or insulin-requiring GDM: the Copenhagen RCT
(<a href="206">206</a>) and the GlucoMOMS RCT (<a href="204">204</a>). The total number of individuals with
T2DM in both studies was n=109 (56 on CGM and 53 on standard therapy).
The Copenhagen RCT included n=123 individuals with T1DM and only 31
individuals with T2DM (16 with CGM and 15 controls), who were randomized
to rtCGM for 6 days at five gestational periods during pregnancy. The
GlucoMOMS study also included many more T1DM (n=109) and GDM individuals
on insulin (n= 108) than individuals with T2DM (n = 78), who were
randomized to wear CGM for about 6 days every 6 weeks but were blinded
to the results. A meta-analysis combining the T2DM individuals in these
trials (n = 109) demonstrated no difference in LGA (OR 0.78, 95% CI
[0.34-1.78]). SGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, NICU admissions, and
glucometrics were not separately reported in those with T2DM, but
preeclampsia was analyzed and shown to be not different (OR 1.63, 95%CI
[0.34-7.22]) (<a href="207">207</a>). A third RCT randomized 71 pregnant individuals (n =
46 with T1DM, n= 25 with T2DM) to CGM versus standard medical care
(<a href="205">205</a>). However, the 25 individuals with T2DM (10 on CGM and 15 on
standard therapy) were not analyzed separately, so pregnancy outcomes
could not be determined. When the analysis from the three RCTs was not
restricted to only T2DM but also included T1DM and GDM, there was still
no difference in LGA (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.34–1.78) nor was there a
statistical difference in rates of neonatal hypoglycemia (OR, 0.96; 95%
CI 0.75-1.23), or NICU admissions (OR, 1.01; 95% CI 0.65-1.59),</p>
<p class="text">The certainty of the evidence for using CGM for T2DM in pregnancy was
considered very low. Both the Copenhagen and GlucoMOMS trials used
intermittent CGM, and it is not clear whether changes in insulin dose
were primarily based on SMBG or CGM, but they were likely primarily
based on SMBG. Given that results from only 56 individuals with T2DM and
53 controls are available from two RCTs for analysis, this small sample
size could lead to imprecision when assessing outcomes.</p>
<p class="text">Although the GlucoMOMS RCT did not have adequate sample size to
determine the efficacy of CGM, Rademaker published a post-hoc analysis
to determine if CGM metrics correlated with pregnancy outcomes (<a href="208">208</a>). A
major limitation of the GlucoMOMs trial was that offline glucose
profiles were obtained by clinicians retrospectively after each week of
blinded CGM, and the individuals could not see the data in real time.
None of the measured glycemic metrics improved over trimesters in
subjects with T2DM alone, including TIR, mean glucose, and HbA1C. These
findings contrast with those from individuals with T1DM in whom TIR and
mean glucose improved.</p>
<p class="text">In the CONCEPTT RCT for T1DM, the benefits for neonatal outcomes were
very large, with ORs about 0.50 for LGA (53% vs. 69%), NICU stays more
than 24 hours (27% vs. 43%), and neonatal hypoglycemia (15% vs. 28%),
although the differences in glycemic measures were modest (~0.2%
difference in HbA1C, 68% vs. 61% in TIR, and no difference in severe
hypoglycemia) (<a href="5">5</a>). The number needed to treat (NNT) to improve these
outcomes was only 6 to 8 for T1DM. Whether these same benefits or
glucometric targets will prove beneficial in pregnant individuals with
T2DM requires adequately powered RCTs using current rtCGM technologies
(<a href="209">209</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Indirect evidence in an exclusively T2DM population in pregnancy
includes a recent retrospective study of 360 individuals (<a href="210">210</a>) who
delivered singletons without anomalies at a single academic tertiary
care center between 2019 and 2023 (<a href="210">210</a>). The authors reported their
findings in 82 (22.7%) of pregnant women with T2DM using rtCGM (Dexcom
G6 ® or Freestyle Libre ®) initiated at 21 weeks continuously to
delivery compared with 278 women who used SMBG four times daily and
glucose logs. CGM was associated with an approximately 50% lower odds of
the primary composite neonatal morbidity (65.9% CGM vs. 77% SMBG; aOR
0.48 95% CI [0.24–0.94]) and preterm birth (13.4% vs. 25.2%; aOR 0.48,
95% CI [0.25-0.93]) and nearly a 70% reduction in NICU admissions (33.8%
vs. 47.6%; aOR 0.36 95% CI [0.16-0.8]). This study using current rtCGM
technology included a diverse cohort, and more than half of individuals
had government-assisted or no insurance. There were no differences in
rates of LGA and SGA, neonatal hypoglycemia, and HbA1C before delivery,
but the decrease was greater in the HbA1C from baseline to delivery in
the individuals who used CGM. Gestational weight gain was higher in the
CGM users. The individuals using CGM were more likely to identify as
non-Hispanic Black compared with those using SMBG, and, although their
baseline A1Cs were higher, they had lower BMIs and rates of hypertension
and presented for prenatal care at earlier gestational ages. As a
result, selection bias for the individuals who used CGM versus those who
did not may have significantly influenced the outcome.</p>
<p class="text">Another retrospective study in Alabama adds to indirect evidence and
included 117 individuals of whom 58% had T1DM and 42% had T2DM (<a href="211">211</a>).
This study demonstrated that 83% of the cohort developed at least one of
the composite adverse pregnancy outcomes (neonatal mortality, LGA or SGA
infant, NICU admission, hypoglycemia, birth trauma, or
hyperbilirubinemia) (<a href="211">211</a>). Different glucose metrics were related to
outcomes: specifically, for each 5% increase in TIR, the odds of
neonatal morbidity decreased by 28%; the associations appeared similar
in T1DM and T2DM.</p>
<p class="text">In T2DM outside of pregnancy, CGM was superior to SBGM for HbA1C
reduction (WMCD -0.40; 95% CI -0.55-0.24) (<a href="212">212</a>). Data in T2DM outside of
pregnancy, especially in individuals using insulin, demonstrate that
rtCGM improves HbA1C and TIR (70–180 mg/dL) and may reduce all-cause
hospitalizations (<a href="213">213</a>). Reaven (<a href="214">214</a>), but these improvements have
largely occurred without changes in insulin dose or medications.
Difficulties in extrapolating data from T2DM outside of pregnancy to
pregnancy include the different TIR targets in T2DM outside of pregnancy
(70–180 mg/dL), that the four times a day fasting and postprandial SMBG
was not the standard-of-care control group, and the primary outcomes
were very different than those in pregnancy (prevention of fetal
overgrowth and adverse pregnancy outcomes).</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Factors </p>
<p class="text">We did not identify any studies evaluating patient’s values regarding
the prioritized outcomes, yet the GDP considered the selected outcomes
to be highly important to most individuals with T2DM.</p>
<p class="text">We did not identify any study that summarized the required resources
and associated costs for implementing CGM in pregnant individuals with
T2DM. From a broader perspective, the resources required are likely to
be much greater in T2DM compared with T1DM if CGM use were to be
expanded due to the rapidly increasing prevalence of T2DM. Furthermore,
the population with T2DM has much less experience with CGM as do many
obstetric (OB) clinicians who often care for this population. Additional
costs related to patient and clinician education and training might not
be currently available. However, efforts to train OBs in CGM and CGM
access are increasing, including non-prescription CGM, so CGM
acceptability and use are likely to increase over time (<a href="215">215</a>). No formal
cost-effectiveness analysis was identified.</p>
<p class="text">Overall, the GDP judged that using CGM in individuals with T2DM
during pregnancy was feasible and acceptable. A feasibility and
acceptability study conducted in Northern Australia in 57 pregnant
individuals with T2DM using intermittently scanned CGM (Free Style
Libre) (<a href="216">216-218</a>) reported a mean sensor use of about 12 weeks and mean
sensor activity of 60%. Forty-one individuals used CGM for 15 weeks with
some modest but limited change in the average glucometrics from early to
late pregnancy. LGA infants were associated with hyperglycemic metrics
early in pregnancy. Each 1% TIR was associated with a 4% to 5% reduction
in neonatal complications. Most participants found CGM “worthwhile,” and
94% would recommend its use to others. Reasons for discontinuing the
sensor included skin irritations (25%), sensors falling off early, and
distrust of CGM accuracy.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">Adequately powered RCTs comparing continual rtCGM with SMBG in
pregnant individuals with T2DM that demonstrate improvements in any of
the outcomes prioritized by the panel were not identified (<a href="204">204-207</a>). The
panel evaluated the indirect evidence supporting 1) improved
glucometrics using CGM in T2DM outside of pregnancy (<a href="213">213</a>); 2)
substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes including LGA infants,
NICU stays, and neonatal hypoglycemia in individuals using CGM in T1DM
(<a href="5">5</a>); and 3) the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with
improved glucometrics in individuals with (<a href="208">208</a>,<a href="211">211</a>,<a href="219">219</a>). A recent
retrospective study using current CGM technology demonstrated an
improvement in composite neonatal morbidity, NICU admissions, and
preterm birth was also factored in (<a href="210">210</a>).</p>
<p class="text">The benefits of CGM in T2DM outside of pregnancy cannot be directly
extrapolated to T2DM in pregnancy because, in the non-pregnant
population, individuals infrequently use four times daily SMBG, the TIR
target of 180 mg/dL is higher, and the major differences in primary
outcomes measured are HbA1C and hospitalizations compared with adverse
pregnancies outcomes.</p>
<p class="text">It is also problematic to extrapolate the data from CGM in T1DM in
pregnancy to T2DM in pregnancy given the multiple drivers of adverse
outcomes and fetal overgrowth associated in T2DM compared with T1DM and
a lower risk of maternal hypoglycemia in T2DM. Indirect evidence also
suggests that in both T2DM and GDM, higher and tighter TIR and a lower
mean glucose may be required to improve pregnancy outcomes
(<a href="20">20</a>,<a href="197">197-199</a>,<a href="215">215</a>,<a href="220">220</a>,<a href="221">221</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Retrospective studies supporting use in T2DM were likely to suffer
from selection bias, and it was not clear whether the standard of care
(four times daily SMBG) was being consistently used in the control
groups.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP considered that both CGM and SBGM could be used during
pregnancy to support glucose monitoring and improve glycemia. This
recommendation is derived from limited direct evidence evaluating the
effect of CGM use in the outcomes of interest and from indirect evidence
that supports potential benefits when compared with SBGM. This is an
important consideration, as the GDP judged that glucose monitoring and
achieving glycemic targets is important for the pregnant patient, but
the available evidence of EtD factors does not demonstrate superiority
of CGM versus no CGM (SBGM).</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Because T2DM is a heterogenous disorder of variable insulin
resistance and insulin deficiency, certain subgroups may benefit from
CGM , including those using pumps, those with more severe insulin
deficiency, and those with higher risk for maternal hypoglycemia.
Certain individuals, especially those using CGM before pregnancy, may
prefer CGM over SMBG given ease of use. Others are likely to value it
less due to “sensor fatigue” from alarms, site irritation, and sensor
failure. Quality of life and glycemia may improve with continuous rtCGM
in some subgroups who use the data to change lifestyle and treatment
practices based on real-time data and immediate feedback. Individuals
and clinicians should collaborate when deciding if CGM or SMBG will best
address the needs of each individual.</p>
<p class="text">A glycemic range between 63-140 mg/dl (3.5–7.8 mmol/l) is currently
recommended in pregnancy. The CGM metric for time in range (TIR) in
pregnancy is &gt;70% in T1DM and not defined by possibly &gt;90% in T2DM
(<a href="222">222</a>). Ideal glycemic range and TIR for pregnancies complicated by all
types of diabetes need further study. The recommended TIR by CGM may
need to be higher in T2DM than in T1DM, and tighter glycemic targets and
a lower mean glucose may need to be achieved earlier in pregnancy in
T2DM and in GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes (<a href="199">199</a>,<a href="216">216</a>,<a href="220">220-222</a>). The
risk of hypoglycemia is much lower in T2DM, and other metabolic factors,
apart from simply glucose, are likely to contribute to adverse pregnancy
outcomes (<a href="20">20</a>,<a href="197">197-199</a>,<a href="223">223</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Several RCTs of T2DM in pregnancy comparing rtCGM to standard care
are currently in progress in the US and UK and will be valuable in
addressing this question but have yet to be completed (<a href="224">224</a>,<a href="225">225</a>). Other
suggested studies include the following.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Robust RCTs adequately powered for an improvement in pregnancy
outcomes are greatly needed to determine if there are benefits of
continuous rtCGM in pregnant individuals with T2DM compared with fasting
and postprandial SMBG, what CGM metrics are predictive, the degree of
improvement in glycemic metrics that are required to decrease neonatal
morbidity, when in gestation improved glucose metrics are most
important, and the potential of Artificial Intelligence to facilitate
interpretation of these large data sets which can translate into
improved clinical outcomes. .</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Given the heterogeneity of individuals with T2DM, studies will be
needed to determine if specific cohorts of individuals with more severe
insulin deficiency or specific metabolic phenotypes, comorbidities, and
cultural backgrounds may accept and benefit from CGM compared with
others. Individuals with T2DM using insulin pumps attempting to achieve
lower glycemia targets may experience more benefit and may need to be
evaluated separately.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Cost-effectiveness and feasibility trials are also a priority
given the substantial resources that will be needed for both clinicians
and individuals and the lower number of individuals with T2DM who are
accustomed to using CGM.</p>
<p class="h1">Single Continuous Glucose Monitor Glycemic Target vs. Standard of Care Pregnancy Fasting and Postprandial Targets </p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Since the CONCEPTT RCT demonstrated a reduction in rates of LGA and
neonatal hypoglycemia with the addition of CGM in pregnancies
complicated by T1DM, CGM is increasingly used in pregnancy (<a href="5">5</a>,<a href="226">226</a>).
Currently recommended, long-standing glycemic targets in pregnancy
are:</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Fasting glucose 70-95 mg/dL (3.9-5.3 mmol/l)</p>
<p class="listlevel3">1-hour postprandial glucose 110-140 mg/dL (6.1-7.8
mmol/l)</p>
<p class="listlevel3">2-hour postprandial glucose 100-120 mg/dL (5.6-6.7
mmol/l)</p>
<p class="text">In 2019, with the advent of CGM, the International Consensus on Time
in Range recommended that the TIR range in pregnancy be defined as 63 to
140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/l) using the definition chosen in previous
studies in predominantly T1DM in pregnancy, which generally used
traditional fasting and postprandial targets for insulin adjustment
(<a href="222">222</a>,<a href="227">227</a>,<a href="228">228</a>). The International Consensus in Time in Range further
suggested that the TIR metric for T1DM be more than 70% (63–140 mg/dL
[3.5–7.8 mmol/l]) based on data from CONCEPTT. The metric was left
undefined for T2DM due to lack of data, but &gt;han 90% (63–140 mg/dL
[3.5–7.8 mmol/l]) is often suggested for T2DM (<a href="222">222</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In practice, the recommended TIR is being used as a target instead of
a metric and thereby targeting higher nocturnal and premeal levels of
glycemia, despite the ADA recommendation that CGM metrics should not be
used as a substitute for fasting and postprandial glucose targets (<a href="3">3</a>).
The effect of using different targets on pregnancy outcomes is unclear,
and this is critical due to evidence that glucose targets are strongly
associated with maternal and neonatal outcomes. In fact, the
International Consensus on Time in Range noted in their recommendation
that “Recent data suggest that even more stringent targets and greater
attention to overnight glucose profiles may be required…” (<a href="222">222</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Even mild hyperglycemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse
maternal and neonatal outcomes, including LGA and neonatal hypoglycemia
(<a href="21">21</a>,<a href="199">199</a>,<a href="202">202</a>,<a href="208">208</a>,<a href="228">228-247</a>). Therefore, establishing ideal glycemic targets
is critical.</p>

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">No RCTs were identified that compared the effects of using a 24-hour
CGM target of 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/l) to using traditional
pregnancy glucose targets [fasting 70-95 mg/dl (3.9-5.3 mmol/L), 1 hour
post prandial 110-140 mg/dl (6.1-7.8 mmol/L), 2 hour post prandial
100-120 mg/dl (5.6-6.7mmol/L)] in individuals with PDM on the outcomes
of interest:</p>

<p class="listlevel3">SGA</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Neonatal hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Glucometrics (including TIR, TBR, and TAR)</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Glycemic emergencies</p>
<p class="text">Indirect evidence supports using a 24-hour CGM TIR target of 63 to
140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) in individuals with PDM by demonstrating
association with maternal and neonatal outcomes (including LGA infants
and neonatal hypoglycemia) (<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="5">5</a>,<a href="211">211</a>,<a href="228">228</a>,<a href="248">248-250</a>). However, other CGM
metrics and measures of glycemia are also associated with these
outcomes.</p>
<p class="text">The 2017 CONCEPTT trial was a multi-center RCT including 215
pregnancies complicated by T1DM with suboptimal glycemia for pregnancy
(HbA1C, 6.5%–10.0%) comparing standard of care to standard of care plus
the addition of CGM (<a href="5">5</a>). CONCEPTT demonstrated that CGM use resulted in
improved neonatal outcomes with reductions in LGA (53% vs. 69%;
<span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0210) and rates of neonatal hypoglycemia (15% vs. 28%;
<span class="italic">P</span> = 0.0250) (5,251). There were no differences in SGA or rates
of maternal hypoglycemia (<a href="5">5</a>). CONCEPTT provided no comparison of CGM TIR
to traditional targets.</p>
<p class="text">Meek concluded that TIR, TAR, and HbA1C were the most predictive of
outcomes, including LGA and rates of neonatal hypoglycemia, although
predictive ability varied by trimester (<a href="252">252</a>). Overnight and fasting
glucose levels were not explored.</p>
<p class="text">A 2023 retrospective cohort study of CGM use in 102 pregnancies
complicated by T1DM explored the use of unique CGM parameters (<a href="249">249</a>). For
LGA, second and third trimester HbA1C, mean glucose, TAR, and TIR were
all predictors, with TAR in the third trimester being the strongest.
Overnight and fasting glucose levels were not explored. The study
provided no comparison of CGM TIR to traditional glucose targets, but,
similar to the secondary analyses of CONCEPTT, it showed variation in
the strength of association of various CGM metrics with selected
outcomes across the timeline of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">A 2024 retrospective cohort analysis of 117 individuals using CGM
during pregnancy complicated by pre-existing T1DM and T2DM found that
TIR was again associated with LGA and neonatal hypoglycemia but not SGA
(<a href="211">211</a>). Each 5–percentage point increase in TIR reduced odds of the
neonatal composite outcome (LGA, SGA, NICU admission, neonatal
hypoglycemia, birth trauma, and hyperbilirubinemia) by 28% (OR, 0.72;
95% CI: 0.58–0.89) (<a href="211">211</a>). No CGM metrics were predictive of SGA.
Maternal glycemic emergencies were not reported. Overnight and fasting
glucose levels were not explored. This study provided no comparison of
CGM TIR to traditional glucose targets.</p>
<p class="text">Evidence supporting using a traditional fasting glucose target lower
than 95 mg/dL (&lt;3.5 mmol/l) is indirect. A 2016 Cochrane review of
three small RCTs comparing glycemic targets in pregnancies complicated
with PDM concluded, despite low-quality evidence, that fasting glucose
higher than 126 mg/dL (&gt;7 mmol/l) compared to lower than 114 mg/dL
(&lt;6.38 mmol/l) increased risk of macrosomia, preeclampsia, and
cesarean delivery (<a href="253">253</a>). This suggests against the current upper limit
TIR recommended in pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">Several studies demonstrate an association between LGA infants and
overnight glycemia (<a href="238">238</a>,<a href="248">248</a>). These include a 2019 prospective
observational study of 162 pregnancies complicated by GDM, which found
that pregnancies with LGA had higher overnight glucose compared with
those without (108.0 ± 18 mg/dL vs. 99 ± 14.4 mg/dL [6.0 ± 1.0 mmol/l
vs. 5.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l]; <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.005) (<a href="238">238</a>). Also included is
another analysis of the CONCEPTT data that showed that LGA was
associated with mean glucose and mean glucose overnight in the second
trimester, mean glucose and mean glucose overnight in the third
trimester, and TIR and TAR in each trimester (<a href="2">2</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Finally, in a 2022 functional data analysis of more than 10.5 million
CGM glucose measures in 386 pregnancies complicated by T1DM, the
relationship between CGM metrics and LGA infants by time of day
throughout gestation was studied (<a href="248">248</a>). This work highlights the
importance of mean glucose, as it demonstrated a difference of 9 mg/dL
(0.5 mmol/l) in mean glucose across the 24-hour day throughout pregnancy
in pregnancies that resulted in LGA.</p>
<p class="text">In a 2024 retrospective cohort analysis of CGM use in 177 pregnancies
complicated by pre-existing T1DM and T2DM, principal component analysis
and k-means clustering was used to identify distinct four patterns of
glycemia (<a href="215">215</a>):</p>

<p class="listlevel1">Well-controlled (mean glucose = 123 mg/dL [6.83 mmol/l])</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Suboptimal control with high variability (mean glucose = 154
mg/dL [8.6 mmol/l])</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Suboptimal control with minimal circadian variability (mean
glucose = 148 mg/dL [8.3 mmol/l])</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Poorly controlled with peak overnight hyperglycemia (mean glucose
= 166 mg/dL [9.2 mmol/l])</p>

<p class="text">When compared with the well-controlled group, the group with high
variability had higher rates of LGA infants (OR, 3.34 [1.15–9.89]); the
group with minimal circadian variability had higher rates of preterm
birth (OR, 2.59 [1.10–6.24]), cesarean delivery (OR, 2.76; 95% CI:
1.09–7.46), and NICU admission (OR, 4.08 [1.58–11.4]) but not LGA
infants, neonatal hypoglycemia, or preeclampsia; and the poorly
controlled group with peak overnight hyperglycemia had higher rates of
LGA infants (OR, 3.72 [1.37–10.4]), neonatal hypoglycemia (OR, 3.53
[1.37–9.71]), preeclampsia (OR, 2.54 [1.02–6.52]), and NICU admission
(OR, 3.15 [1.2–9.09]). The study provided no comparison of CGM TIR to
traditional targets but found that different patterns of glycemia during
the day were associated with different adverse outcomes, calling into
question whether a single 24 hr glucose target is ideal.</p>
<p class="text">A 2024 observational study on 112 individuals using CGM
intermittently during pregnancy complicated by T1DM explored the
contribution of fasting/overnight glucose to TIR (<a href="254">254</a>). CGM was used for
a 7-day period twice in the first trimester, once in the second, and
twice in the third. Basal hyperglycemia (BHG) was defined as the area
under the curve (AUC) where the glucose was at least 95 mg/dL (5.3
mmol/l) but less than the BG threshold, defined as the average fasting
glucose over that 3-day period for that individual subject. If a
subject’s BG threshold was 95 mg/dL or lower, the BHG was 0. The
contribution of elevated basal glucose (BHG) to high glucose in groups
with TIR (63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8 mmol/l]) lower than 60%, 60% to 78%, and
at least 78% was 74.9% (range 36.8 - 100), 69.2% (13.4,100), and 66.5%
(10.0,100; <span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.001), respectively, showing that BHG was
increasingly a contributor to elevated glucose in those with the lowest
TIR. Similarly, HbA1C was divided into three groups of less than 6.0%,
6.0% to 8.0%, and at least 8.0%, for which the contribution of BHG to
HbA1C was 57.8% (0,100), 72.7% (36.8,100), and 80.7% (31.4,100);
<span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.001), respectively, showing that BHG was likewise
increasingly a contributor to hyperglycemia in those with the highest
HbA1C. The contribution rate of BHG to adverse outcomes was higher than
that of postprandial hyperglycemia (PHG) for most adverse outcomes,
including LGA infants, preterm birth, and preeclampsia, but lower than
that of PHG for neonatal hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="h2">Use of an Alternative Single Glucose Target</p>
<p class="text">In a 2023 multicenter RCT (AiDAPT study) in 124 pregnancies with T1DM
suboptimal glycemia (A1C &ge;6.5%) in early pregnancy (<a href="255">255</a>) the standard
care of insulin treatment with pump or MDI guided by CGM using the usual
targets of fasting glucose 63 to 100 mg/dL (3.5–5.3 mmol/l) and 1-hour
postprandial glucose of lower than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/l) was compared
to use of an HCL pump using an algorithm target of 100 mg/dL (5.5.
mmol/l) in early pregnancy and 81 to 90 mg/dL (4.5–5.0 mmol/l) after 16
weeks. The intervention group had higher TIR (68.2% ± 10.5 vs. 55.6% ±
12.5), lower mean glucose (125 mg/dL ± 14 mg/dL vs. 136 mg/dL ± 16
mg/dL), lower A1C (6.0% ± 0.5 vs. 6.4% ± 0.5), lower mean glucose
overnight (125 mg/dL ± 14 mg/dL vs. 135 mg/dl ± 17 mg/dL), and fewer
mild (–1.7 [–3.0 to –0.5]) and moderate (–0.7 [–1.4 to 0.0])
hypoglycemic events with no difference in serious hypoglycemic events.
Pregnancy outcomes were not analyzed statistically since the study had
not been powered for this.</p>
<p class="text">AiDAPT compared attainment of pregnancy-specific TIR (63–140 mg/dL)
(3.5–7.8 mmol/L) while using HCL technology and adjusting the algorithm
target throughout pregnancy with traditional insulin delivery without
HCL technology (MDI or pump). So, while it demonstrated the feasibility
of tighter targets in PDM when using HCL technology, it did not directly
compare the current recommended TIR targets to traditional targets.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Consideration</p>
<p class="text">The GDP determined that the five selected outcomes were important to
most individuals, although no primary study directly assessed patient’s
values. Additional resources for education and CGM/pump reporting would
be needed to change glycemic targets in pregnancy, but the cost would
not be large. We identified no cost-effectiveness studies comparing
specific targets in pregnancies complicated by PDM. CGM use in pregnancy
has already been shown to be cost-effective (<a href="256">256-259</a>), as well as
acceptable and feasible (<a href="5">5</a>,<a href="260">260</a>). Aligning TIR recommendations with
existing fasting and postprandial targets is unlikely to significantly
impact acceptability or feasibility. Studies of HCL pump technology have
demonstrated the feasibility of achieving lower overnight TIR (<a href="255">255</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">There is no RCT comparing a single 24-hour CGM target of 63 to 140
mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/l) with traditional pregnancy glucose targets
[fasting 70-95 mg/dl (3.9-5.3 mmol/L), 1 hour post prandial 110-140
mg/dl (6.1-7.8 mmol/L), 2 hour post prandial 100-120 mg/dl
(5.6-6.7mmol/L)] in pregnancy complicated by PDM. In the absence of
direct evidence, the certainty of the evidence is considered to be very
low.</p>
<p class="text">Adopting a single TIR target in the absence of evidence is a concern,
as outcomes in individuals who achieve the recommended TIR remain
suboptimal (<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="5">5</a>,<a href="228">228</a>,<a href="248">248-250</a>). The GDP identified indirect evidence that
supports using traditional fasting targets to improve rates of LGA
(<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="211">211</a>,<a href="248">248</a>,<a href="254">254</a>) and neonatal hypoglycemia (<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="211">211</a>,<a href="248">248</a>). The GDP placed
high value on the evidence supporting the need to achieve
overnight/fasting glucose values as required in the traditional targets;
therefore, in the absence of comparative studies, the GDP recommended
against using a single target of 6&lt; 140 mg/dL (&lt;7.8 mmol/l).</p>
<p class="text">Ideal glucose targets in PDM are not known. Improving outcomes may
require a lower peak postprandial target. There is indirect evidence in
a GDM population that a lower postprandial target of less than 120 mg/dL
would be beneficial (<a href="247">247</a>)), and 120 mg/dL (6.6 mmol/l) is closer to
euglycemia (<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="215">215</a>,<a href="248">248</a>,<a href="261">261</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Another possible reason for suboptimal outcomes is that using a
single TIR target does not account for the contribution to poor outcomes
of fasting/overnight hyperglycemia. There is indirect evidence for this
as studies have shown associations between the relationship of
fasting/overnight glycemia and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes
(<a href="2">2</a>,<a href="215">215</a>,<a href="248">248</a>,<a href="254">254</a>,<a href="261">261</a>).</p>
<p class="text">There is concern that the predictive value of fasting glucose on
negative outcomes, including LGA infants, might be ignored if the focus
is on a single 24-hour target. So, given the lack of direct evidence
supporting using TIR as the target in PDM in pregnancy, we suggest
against the routine use of a single target.</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Ideal fasting and postprandial targets need to be determined for PDM.
Suggested studies include the following.</p>
<p class="listlevel1">RCTs
comparing currently recommended TIR metrics to traditional fasting and
postprandial glucose targets and to lower glycemic targets in PDM are a
practical and immediate need. Nocturnal and daytime targets may need
differentiation, and targets may need to differ between T1DM and T2DM.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Additional studies are needed on glycemia by both time of day and
by gestational age and their relationships to maternal and neonatal
outcomes in both normal pregnancy and PDM.</p>
<p class="text">These are important, as in practice, more and more individuals and
providers are focusing on achieving TIR rather than fasting and
postprandial targets (<a href="128">128</a>). It is also a practical
and immediate need as advancing pump technology is now reducing the
barriers to achieving targets even in the euglycemic range, and there is
data suggesting that too-tight control of glycemia in pregnancy can
increase the risk of SGA in GDM (<a href="262">262</a>,<a href="263">263</a>) and of miscarriage in T1DM
(<a href="264">264</a>).</p>
<p class="h1">Hybrid Closed Loop Pump (pump adjusting automatically based on continuous glucose monitor) vs. Insulin Pump with Continuous Glucose Monitor (without an algorithm) or Multiple Daily Insulin Injections with Continuous Glucose Monitor</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">PDM presents formidable challenges to maintaining the optimal
glycemia necessary to prevent poor maternal and fetal outcomes (<a href="255">255</a>).
Glycemic metrics in pregnancy, including HbA1C, pre- and post- prandial
glucose, and TIR, are strongly associated with pregnancy outcomes
(<a href="265">265-268</a>). The physical and psychological burden of diabetes
self-management outside of pregnancy is well-documented. Coupling that
burden with the tight glycemic targets and other demands of pregnancy
adds additional stress and anxiety during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">The use of HCL pumps outside of pregnancy has shown improvements in
HbA1C, TIR, rates of hypoglycemia, and quality of life (<a href="200">200</a>). There are
few studies regarding the use of HCL pumps in pregnancy, but these
limited studies have shown promise for individuals with T1DM
(<a href="255">255</a>,<a href="265">265-269</a>). The use of HCL pumps has been reported to improve both
glycemia and quality of life (<a href="255">255</a>,<a href="265">265</a>,<a href="267">267</a>,<a href="268">268</a>). HCL pumps have the
potential to improve outcomes and reduce the unrelenting burden of
diabetes self-management in pregnancy. Therefore, the GDP prioritized
this question. </p>
<p class="h2">Question 8</p>
<p class="text">Should a hybrid closed loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based
on continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) vs. insulin pump with CGM (without
an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM be used in
individuals with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are pregnant? </p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 8</p>
<p class="text">In individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are pregnant,
we suggest the use of a hybrid closed loop pump (pump adjusting

insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin
injections with CGM. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>)</p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remarks</p>

<p class="listlevel1">The individual algorithms used by HCL technology vary in their

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review identified five RCTs (<a href="255">255</a>). (<a href="265">265</a>,<a href="267">267-269</a>) and
one prospective cohort study (<a href="266">266</a>) evaluating the effect of a hybrid
closed loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) for
individuals with pre-existing T1DM who are pregnant when compared to
insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin

<p class="listlevel3">LGA</p>

<p class="listlevel3">Neonatal hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Glucometrics (TIR, TAR, TBR)</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Severe maternal hyper- or hypoglycemia</p>

<p class="text">The results of the meta-analysis showed that TIR was higher in the
pregnant women using HCL pumps compared with standard care (MD, 3.62%;
CI: 3.17–10.41), TBR was lower (MD, –0.94%; CI: –1.82 to -0.07), and TAR
did not differ. TAR and TIR did not differ when analyzed based on
trimester. Finally, no significant differences were found in rates of
LGA (RR, 0.95; CI: 0.66–1.37), SGA (RR, 4.06; CI: 0.46–35.60), or
neonatal hypoglycemia (RR, 1.19; CI: 0.23–6.20). The reported studies
provided direct evidence of the effects of HCL pump use in women with
pre-existing T1DM in pregnancy. Limitations of the primary evidence
included small sample size (from 10 to 124 women evaluated, and mostly
White) leading to imprecision, evaluation of different pump
technologies, sensors and algorithms, initiation of the intervention at
different time points during pregnancy with different glucose targets
and variability in diet composition and carbohydrate intake of
participants. These factors should be considered when evaluating study
results.</p>
<p class="h2">Glucometrics</p>
<p class="text">Stewart et al. conducted a randomized crossover study comparing
overnight HCL therapy with the control group using sensor-augmented pump
therapy (SAPT) in 16 pregnant individuals with T1DM (<a href="268">268</a>), to examine
the safety, efficacy and long-term feasibility of the two systems.
Pregnant women randomized between 8 and 20 gestational weeks of
pregnancy, were age 18-45 years, with a level of HbA1C between 6.5% and
10%. The primary end point was a TIR of 65-140 mg/dL (3.6-7.8 mmol/L),
and a secondary outcome was an TBR lower than 63 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L).
During the overnight phase, the overnight time in range (TIR) was 74.7%
vs 59.5 %, absolute difference 15.2%, (95% CI 6.1 to 24.2, p=0.002)
higher for the HCL group, with no statistical difference in time below
range (TBR &lt;63 mg/dL/3.5 mmol/L) (1.3 vs 1.9, mean adjusted
difference between groups (0.6, 95% CI -1.7 to 0.6) .</p>
<p class="text">During the continuation phase, 14 women used HCL for the entire
24-hour period until the time of delivery, and 12 continued use up to 6
weeks postpartum (<a href="270">270</a>). During the continuation phase HCL therapy was
associated with comparable levels of glycemia and significantly less
nocturnal hypoglycemia than sensor augmented pump therapy (SAPT) (1.6 vs
2.7%, mean adjusted difference between group -1.1, CI-0.2 to-2.1,
p=0.06).</p>
<p class="text">This study went on to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using
HCL for glucose management during labor, delivery and postpartum. Users
of HCL during these critical times spent 82% of their time in TIR during
labor and delivery with a mean glucose of 124 mg/dL ± 36 SD (6.9 mmol/L
± 2.1 SD). Individuals in the HCL group maintained this level of
glycemia regardless of the delivery method including vaginal, elective
Cesarean Section and emergency Cesarean Section.</p>
<p class="text">In a 2023 multicenter RCT, Lee et al, assessed the efficacy of HCL
therapy, randomized 124 women with T1DM 18 to 45 years old, before 14
weeks gestation with HbA1C levels from 6% to 11%, to either standard
insulin therapy using MDI with CGM or SAPT vs HCL (<a href="255">255</a>). The primary
outcome was the percentage of TIR time in the pregnancy specific target
glucose range (glucose targets (63-140 mg/dL /3.5-7.8 mmol/L).
Individuals using HCL spent more time in pregnancy-specific time in
range (TIR) during the treatment period (from 47.8±16.4% at baseline to
68.2 ±10.5% during the treatment period in the closed loop group and
from 44.5±14.4 % at baseline to 55.6±12.5% during the treatment period
in the standard group (mean adjusted difference between groups 10.5
percentage points, (95% CI 7.0 to 14.0, p&lt;0.001), less time in
pregnancy-specific time above range (TAR &gt;140 mg/dL/7.8 mmol/L) (from
48.7±18% at baseline to 29.2 ±10.6% during the treatment period in the
closed loop group and from 51.8±16.2 % at baseline to 41.4±13.2 % during
the treatment period in the standard group (mean adjusted difference
between groups - 10.2 percentage points, 95% CI -13.8 to -6.6,
p&lt;0.001), and less pregnancy-specific time below range (TBR &lt; 63
mg/dL /3.5 mmol/L) from 2.75 % at baseline to 2.26 % during the
treatment period in the closed loop group and from 2.26% at baseline to
2.02% during the treatment period in the standard group (mean adjusted
difference between groups -0.43 percentage points, 95% CI -1.04 to
0.19), than controls.</p>
<p class="text">A multicenter prospective real-world cohort study in Spain compared
glucometrics and maternal-fetal outcomes of 112 women with pre-existing
T1DM using HCL with a median glucose target at 99 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L)
versus MDI with CGM (<a href="266">266</a>). The mean age of participants was 34.8 years,
with HbA1C levels between 6.3% to 7.7%. Both groups had increased TIR
(63-140 mg/dL / 3.5-7.8 mmol/L) and decreased TAR (&gt; 140 mg/dL/7.8
mmol/L) at the second and third trimester with respect to first
trimester. The HCL group spent less TBR (&lt;63 mg/dL/3.5 mmol/L)
compared to MDI group (3% vs 2% vs 1% from first to second and third
trimester HCL vs 4% vs 3% vs 2% MDI from first to second and third
trimester, p&lt;0.05). The HCL group gained more weight and had a higher
prevalence of fetal macrosomia, yet there was no difference in TIR, TAR
and HbA1C. Several factors could explain the results of the study. The
well-controlled baseline glycemic state of the individuals of the two
groups could have mitigated the impact of HCL therapy. The CGM derived
data was obtained from different sensors and several different HCL pump
algorithms were used. Finally, the lower glucose targets of 80-90 mg/dL
(4.4-5.0 mmol/L) after 16-20 weeks were used only in the HCL arm.</p>
<p class="text">A European RCT evaluated an HCL system that uses an algorithm that
automatically adapts the basal insulin rate and provides automated
insulin bolus to correct for hyperglycemia and has a glucose
concentration target of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) ability to improve
glycemic control with less hypoglycemia in 95 women with pre-existing
type 1 diabetes in pregnancy, age 18-45 years, median start of therapy
10 gestational weeks, HbA1cvalues 7% to 9% (<a href="265">265</a>). Of note, even though
this is a HCL pump, it does not accommodate pregnancy-specific glucose
targets in its algorithm. This study demonstrated a non-significant 3.3%
overall improvement for mean TIR for women using HCL versus standard
therapy (MDI/SAPT), (66.5±10% vs 63.2±12.4, adjusted mean difference of
1.88, 95% CI -0.82 to4.68, p = 0.17).</p>
<p class="text">In one RCT, the authors compared HCL therapy to SAPT without specific
glucose targets in 23 women with pre-existing T1DM to evaluate safety,
glucometrics and health outcomes. Participants were enrolled in the
first trimester, randomized at 14-18 weeks of gestation, mean age 31
years, mean HbA1C values 6.8% (<a href="269">269</a>). This study used an HCL pump, with
participants randomized to using its activated HCL algorithm or the HCL
algorithm. The HCL glucose target was 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L), but lower
targets could be used by deactivating the HCL algorithm (SAPT). Time
spent below 63mg/dL/3.5mmol/L (TBR) decreased in both groups,
significantly in the HCL group (3.5± 1.3% second trimester and 2.8±1.3%
third trimester vs 7.9± 1.3% run in phase, p&lt; 0.05 for both).
However, those using SAPT had a 3.9% improvement in TIR (63-140 mg/dl)
in the third trimester with respect to run in phase compared to their
HCL counterparts (68.2± 3.1% vs 64.3± 3.1, p&lt;0.05%). There was no
difference in adverse safety or pregnancy outcomes between HCL and SAPT.
The improved 3rd trimester A1C and average glucose noted in the SAPT
group suggests the importance of which glycemic targets are used in
pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">The studies that analyzed the use of HCL in pregnancy have
demonstrated safe use of this system, along with some benefits. Women
with pre-existing T1DM spent more time in pregnancy-specific TIR with
less TBR in most studies (<a href="255">255</a>,<a href="265">265</a>,<a href="268">268</a>,<a href="270">270</a>), but not in all (<a href="266">266</a>,<a href="269">269</a>).
Furthermore, many women with lower TIR in early pregnancy increased
their TIR with the use of HCL technology, although using lower pregnancy
targets in the AiDAPT study may have contributed to the favorable
findings in the HCL technology arm (<a href="255">255</a>). Finally, pregnant women who
had higher TIR in early pregnancy maintained or increased their TIR in
later pregnancy and reported a decrease in their overall diabetes
burden, worry about the health of their unborn child along with improved
sleep. As a result, the GDP discerned that the evaluated evidence
probably favors the intervention.</p>
<p class="h2">Harms</p>
<p class="text">The GDP also considered the undesirable effects from the intervention
to be to be trivial.</p>
<p class="text">Stewart et al reported 95 device failures, 18 during SAPT, 21 during
closed loop therapy and 56 during run in and continuation phase but none
resulted in maternal severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (<a href="267">267</a>,<a href="268">268</a>). Lee
et al reported no differences in device-related adverse events in the
two groups of individuals evaluated, (<a href="255">255</a>). Benhalima et al reported no
differences in the device failures in the two groups (40 vs 39) with no
related adverse events (<a href="265">265</a>). No adverse events related to device
defects were reported by Polsky and Quiros (<a href="266">266</a>,<a href="269">269</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In the RCT study of Lee et al no differences in pregnancy outcomes of
preterm birth, birth weight<span class="bold">,</span> neonatal complications or
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit are reported. The higher
prevalence of repeat cesarean section among participants in HCL group
versus the group receiving standard of care (42% vs 18%) was felt to be
related to the participants’ Cesarean delivery in previous pregnancies
(<a href="255">255</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Quiros, et.al reported that newborns of HCL users were more likely to
have higher birthweight (βadjusted 279.0 g, 95% CI 39.5-518.5) and
macrosomia (OR adjusted 3.18, 95% CI 1.05-9.67) compared to MDI users.
However, these associations disappeared when maternal weight gain or
third trimester HbA1C were included in the models (<a href="266">266</a>).</p>
<p class="text">In the RCT by Polksy et al no differences in pregnancy outcomes of
preterm birth, birth weight<span class="bold">,</span> neonatal complications or
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit are reported (<a href="269">269</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Consideration</p>
<p class="text">Resources needed for implementation include access to HCL technology
and training for clinicians and increased diabetes self-management
education and support (DSMES) for individuals. Rankin et al. interviewed
19 health care professionals about their views on the training and
support needed to roll out HCL technology to pregnant women with T1DM
(<a href="271">271</a>). Interviewees identified challenges and opportunities to this
rollout and provided practical suggestions to upskill inexperienced
staff who would be supporting individuals using the technology. A key
priority will be to determine how best to develop such services.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP also considered the potentially higher cost of more advanced
technologies such as HCL pumps compared with insulin pumps with CGM and
MDI with CGM, due to differences in cost and reimbursement of medication
and diabetes supplies in different countries. Clinicians and health care
systems also require training and available experts to support
high-quality implementation of these technologies. From the clinician’s
perspective, the costs of technical training of device insertion,
reading reports, and interpreting data may be cost-prohibitive.</p>
<p class="text">None of the reviewed articles evaluated the costs of implementing HCL
pumps or provided sufficient data on the main outcomes to determine
cost-effectiveness (<a href="153">153</a>,<a href="200">200</a>,<a href="255">255</a>,<a href="265">265</a>,<a href="266">266</a>,<a href="268">268-270</a>). CGM alone has been
shown to be cost-effective in pregnancies in women with Type 1 diabetes.
Feig et al. reports that if the National Health Service (NHS) in the
United Kingdom paid for CGM for all women with T1DM during pregnancy,
this would save £9.6 million per year, a cost reduction of 40% compared
with SMBG (<a href="227">227</a>). The infants of women with T1DM using CGM in pregnancy
had shorter NICU stays.</p>
<p class="text">Ozaslan et al. evaluated the feasibility of using closed-loop insulin
delivery with a zone model predictive control (MPC) algorithm designed
to be used by women with pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy (<a href="272">272</a>).
Eleven pregnant women already using SAPT were enrolled in and completed
this 2-day study, which demonstrated that a customized closed-loop
control system tailored to pregnancy glucose targets is feasible for
women previously using SAPT.<br />
The panel judged the feasibility of the intervention will vary. These
technologies are not available in all countries, and which technologies
are available varies from country to country. Costs may be prohibitive
to individuals and health care systems may not have the resources
necessary to support their use. The intervention may be feasible if
individualized management is performed, taking into consideration
factors such as patients' preferences, accessibility, costs and access
to careful clinical monitoring.</p>
<p class="text">There was some evidence for acceptability. Wang et al. took a
qualitative study approach by interviewing four Canadian women with
pre-existing T1DM in pregnancy using a HCL system, who reported a
reduction in the burden of diabetes management and improved sleep (<a href="273">273</a>).
Lawton et al. also took a qualitative approach to study the lived
experiences of 23 women with pre-existing T1DM in pregnancy using HCL
technology, with the aim of informing health care clinicians on best
practices for antenatal rollout and guidance and support for future
users. These interviews revealed that HCL users experienced less
diabetes self-management burden and worried less about diabetes-related
pregnancy complications and being judged negatively by health care
clinicians (<a href="81">81</a>,<a href="200">200</a>,<a href="274">274</a>). Additionally, they reported that having
intensive input into their care and the support of health care
professionals in early pregnancy contributed to successful adjustment to
using HCL technology. Participants emphasized the importance of
education in helping them make daily care decisions using HCL
technology. These results suggest reducing the burden of diabetes with
HCL technology and the need for adequate education to support effective
use.</p>
<p class="text">Data are scarce on the impact of the intervention on health equity.
Only the CONCEPTT trial has evaluated individuals with different
nationalities. Additionally, mostly White women have be included in the
studies (<a href="227">227</a>). Our meta-analysis reports that most users of HCL were
highly educated (many with a bachelor’s degree or higher) White women,
who were able to maintain contact with their diabetes health care team
for frequent insulin adjustments and were able to attend diabetes
self-management education. These attributes may not be generalizable to
other women with PDM using advanced diabetes technologies.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendatio</p>
<p class="text">The identified studies show benefits for the outcomes related to
improved glycemia using HCL systems during pregnancy for individuals
with T1DM when compared to insulin pump delivery with CGM or MDI with
CGM, including overall increased TIR and reduced TBR. No significant
differences were found in maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant
women treated with HCL compared with control groups. There was no
identified harm for using HCL technology, in terms of maternal severe
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, preterm birth, birth weight, neonatal
complications or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The GDP
judged that the intervention was acceptable to patients. This
intervention may be feasible if the user can afford the technology, has
a desire to use the technology, can maintain contact with their diabetes
care team, and can attend diabetes self-management education visits with
educators who are knowledgeable and experienced in using diabetes
technology.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments</p>
<p class="text">Implementation of HCL pump therapy requires expert advice from
someone adept in the use of insulin pumps in pregnancy. The individual
algorithms used by HCL technology use different glycemic targets and
different algorithms and so vary in their impact on glucometrics and
presumably pregnancy outcomes. The decision on whether or not to use HCL
technology and which technology to use should be made with shared
decision making by the patient and the clinician.</p>
<p class="text">The GDP’s primary objective was to assess the risks and benefits of
HCL in individuals with preexisting T1DM. Yet, women with T2DM have a
higher rate of stillbirths and perinatal mortality than women with T1DM,
so it is also very important that they have good glycemic management
during pregnancy. Further research in this area to better understand the
implications of HCL in T2DM is needed.</p>
<p class="text">Recently, in a 13-week, multicenter trial, adults with
insulin-treated T2DM were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive
automated insulin delivery (AID) or to continue their pretrial
insulin-delivery method (control group); both groups received continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM). A total of 319 patients underwent
randomization. Glycated hemoglobin levels decreased by 0.9 percentage
points (from 8.2±1.4% at baseline to 7.3±0.9% at week 13) in the AID
group and by 0.3 percentage points (from 8.1±1.2% to 7.7±1.1%) in the
control group (mean adjusted difference, -0.6 percentage points; 95%
confidence interval [CI], -0.8 to -0.4; P&lt;0.001). The mean percentage
of time that patients were in TIR (70 to 180 mg /dl) increased from
48±24% to 64±16% in the AID group and from 51±21% to 52±21% in the
control group (mean difference, 14 percentage points; 95% CI, 11 to 17;
P&lt;0.001). So, in T2DM AID was associated with a greater reduction in
glycated hemoglobin levels than CGM alone (<a href="20">20</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Finally, in order to achieve optimal use of these new technologies,
specific training and support for users and health care providers are
important.</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The GDP acknowledges that there are differences between HCL systems
during pregnancy especially in terms of adequate glycemic targets, but
data are not sufficient to suggest a preferential use of one technology.
HCL use during pregnancy must be able to demonstrate a reduction of
adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, yet, most of the studies performed
until now have not be powered for these outcomes. Furthermore, for
optimal use of these new technologies, specific training and support for
users and health care providers are important to maximize the clinical
benefit of these technologies. An evaluation of how to properly
implement these technologies in practice is also required.</p>
<p class="text">Proposed future research questions include:</p>
<p class="listlevel1">Should HCL pumps versus MDI plus CGM be used to manage glycemic
control in pre-existing T2DM in pregnancy?</p>
<p class="listlevel1">For both T1DM vs, T2DM,</p>
<p class="listlevel3">What glycemic targets should HCL pumps use in pregnancy?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Should HCL glycemic targets vary based on time of day or
trimester of pregnancy?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Which HCL algorithms are best in pregnancy?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Should HCL pumps be started before conception or after pregnancy
confirmation in those with PDM?</p>
<p class="h1">Early Delivery Based on Risk Assessment </p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">Individuals with PDM are at higher risk for adverse perinatal
outcomes; glycemia and comorbidities modify these risks. Some adverse
outcomes, including maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
delivery-related morbidity, and stillbirth, may be prevented by delivery
before 39 weeks. However, this is associated with an increased
likelihood of NICU admission and other neonatal morbidities. Optimal
delivery timing balances the known morbidity associated with pre-term
delivery with the risks for stillbirth and maternal complications in
ongoing pregnancy. In women with PDM and ideal glycemia and without
maternal hypertension or fetal growth abnormalities, ACOG recommends
delivery at 39 0/7 to 39 6/7 weeks (<a href="132">132</a>,<a href="275">275</a>,<a href="276">276</a>) . In contrast, in the
presence of vascular complications, hyperglycemia or prior stillbirth,
ACOG guidelines recommend considering delivery at 36 0/7 to 38 6/7
weeks; the existing guidelines do not comment on other common
comorbidities, particularly obesity and other cardiometabolic
abnormalities, that are independently associated with perinatal
morbidity. The GDP prioritized this question because optimizing timing
of delivery will improve outcomes in pregnancies complicated by PDM.</p>
<p class="h2">Question 9 </p>
<p class="text">Should early delivery based on risk assessment vs. expectant
management be used in individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus
(PDM)? </p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 9 </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM), we suggest
early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant
management. (<a href="abbr_2">2</a>|<a href="abbr_POOO">&oplus;OOO</a>) </p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remarks</p>
<p class="listlevel3">There are no validated obstetric risk assessment tools for
individuals with pre-existing diabetes.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Risk-assessment criteria that may be useful to inform ideal
delivery timing include the history of diabetes-related complications,
measures of glycemia, ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic
fluid volume, and presence of other comorbidities associated with
adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Risks may outweigh any benefits of expectant management beyond 38
weeks gestation, even among those with ideal glycemic
management.</p>
<p class="h2">Summary of Evidence</p>
<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a

<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review did not identify any RCT evaluating the impact
of delivery before 39 weeks based on risk assessment on the outcomes of
interest:</p>

<p class="listlevel3">Perinatal mortality</p>
<p class="listlevel3">NICU admission</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Birth trauma</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Maternal mortality</p>

<p class="text">The GDP weighted the indirect evidence demonstrating the risk of
perinatal mortality, particularly stillbirth, at term in PDM.
Additionally, the GDP gave weight to the indirect evidence in the
general population demonstrating the lack of harm and potential benefits
of labor induction at term.</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review identified several retrospective cohort studies
that compared neonatal and maternal outcomes based on timing of delivery
at or beyond 36 weeks’ gestation. Although many of these studies
demonstrated an association of early delivery with adverse outcomes,
particularly before 38 weeks, the GDP considered this indirect evidence
to be of limited utility. Specifically, the GDP was concerned about the
residual confounding inherent in any retrospective study of delivery
timing, as, in clinical practice, individuals who deliver early are not
the same (likely perceived by clinicians to be at higher risk for
morbidity) as those whose pregnancies are managed expectantly. Other
study limitations were the inclusion of individuals with GDM in addition
to those with PDM and lack of standard reporting of confounders such as
measures of glycemia or other measures by which clinical risk assessment
could be performed. Finally, most studies reported composite neonatal
morbidity and mortality; this complicated our assessment of whether
early delivery might be beneficial for the neonate, as delivery
decreases risks for some neonatal complications (such as stillbirth,
macrosomia, and birth trauma) while increasing others, particularly
respiratory morbidity. While there are several RCTs of labor induction
at term, we identified only one that included any individuals with
diabetes; most (94%) of the participants in that study had GDM, and
those with diabetes-related complications were excluded, thus limiting
the generalizability of the findings to pregnancies complicated by PDM
(<a href="277">277</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Based on indirect evidence, the GDP concluded that there were some
neonatal benefits of early delivery (37 0/7–38 6/7 weeks) based on risk
assessment. Though the magnitude of these effects is unclear, the
neonatal benefits of delivery before 39 weeks include prevention of
macrosomia, birth trauma, and stillbirth. The incidence of birth trauma
is associated with fetal size, which increases with increasing
gestational age. In a meta-analysis of studies that excluded individuals
with PDM, labor induction for suspected fetal macrosomia was associated
with a reduced risk for shoulder dystocia (RR, 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37–0.98)
and fracture (RR, 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05–0.79) compared with expectant
management. PDM is consistently associated with stillbirth: a 2024
meta-analysis of 37 studies concluded that PDM was associated with over
a threefold increased risk for stillbirth (pooled OR, 3.74; 95% CI:
3.17–4.41; <span class="italic">I<span class="text-sup">2 </span></span>= 82.5). The risk for stillbirth is
higher among individuals with T2DM, who are more likely to have
cardiometabolic risk factors for stillbirth and to be part of a
minoritized community that experiences inequities in pregnancy outcomes
and less likely to be cared for by dedicated multidisciplinary pregnancy
teams than those with T1DM (<a href="275">275</a>,<a href="278">278</a>). Class 3 obesity may confer
additional risk for stillbirth that should be incorporated into
decisions regarding delivery timing. In a retrospective analysis of more
than 3 million births, while PDM was associated with a more than
ninefold increase in the risk for stillbirth, the adjusted hazard ratio
for stillbirth at 37 to 39 weeks was 25.34 (95% CI: 15.58–41.22) in
those with both PDM and class 3 obesity (<a href="279">279</a>). Retrospective studies
that stratify outcomes by delivery timing in people with diabetes have
not been sufficiently powered to identify a difference in stillbirth and
birth trauma by gestational week. Based on data suggesting that the
population-level risk for stillbirth increases by week at term, the GDP
concluded that early term delivery based on risk factors would reduce
the incidence of stillbirth among people with diabetes.</p>
<p class="text">Based on indirect evidence, the GDP also concluded there were likely
maternal benefits of early delivery using risk stratification. These
include reduced incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
cesarean delivery, and severe maternal morbidity. Retrospective studies
among individuals with PDM have not found an association between week of
delivery and risk for hypertensive disorders or severe maternal
morbidity, in part because hypertensive disorders are an indication for
delivery. However, as the prevalence of hypertension increases at term,
delivery is protective; in a trial of labor induction versus expectant
management in low-risk pregnancies at 39 weeks, labor induction was
associated with a significant decrease in the risk for hypertensive
complications (RR, 0.6; 95% CI: 0.6–0.7) (<a href="280">280</a>). While the overall risk
for cesarean delivery is high among people with diabetes, delivery at
early term is not associated with significant differences in the risk
for cesarean delivery in retrospective data. Early labor induction may
even be protective against cesarean delivery; in low-risk individuals at
term, induction was associated with decreased risk for cesarean delivery
(RR, 0.84: 95% CI: 0.76–0.93). Both hypertension and cesarean delivery
are independently associated with severe maternal morbidity; however, no
studies have demonstrated an association of early delivery with lower
risk for severe maternal morbidity.</p>
<p class="text">Based on indirect evidence, the GDP concluded that the harms of early
delivery based on risk assessment are variable based on gestational age
but trivial after 38 weeks. Potential harms include neonatal morbidity,
such as NICU admission, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia,
hyperbilirubinemia, and other diagnoses that could be related to
prematurity. The GDP did not identify evidence suggesting maternal harm
with early delivery based on risk assessment. Elective early-term (37–38
6/7 weeks) delivery is associated with neonatal morbidity in people
without diabetes (<a href="281">281</a>). Among people with diabetes, delivery at 36 and
37 weeks is consistently associated with neonatal morbidity in
retrospective studies. The harm of delivery is less clear at 38 weeks,
with conflicting data. One large study using administrative data found
an association of iatrogenic delivery, defined as pre-labor cesarean
delivery or labor induction, with neonatal morbidity at 36 and 37 weeks,
but not 38 weeks (<a href="282">282</a>). Similar results were seen in a single-center
study that included 4,750 participants with either PDM or GDM. A
subsequent Canadian population–based study demonstrated a modest
association of delivery at 38 weeks with NICU admission (adjusted [a]RR,
1.61; 95% CI: 1.36–1.90) compared with delivery after 39 weeks (<a href="283">283</a>).
Meanwhile, in an analysis of U.S. natality data, planned delivery at 38
to 39 weeks was associated with lower odds of neonatal morbidity than
expectant management among people with diabetes (aRR, 0.88; 95% CI:
0.77–0.99). The GDP concluded that, in aggregate, the indirect evidence
suggests minimal harm of delivery after 38 weeks (<a href="284">284</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Evidence-to-Decision Factors</p>
<p class="text">The GDP felt there was little variability in the high value of the
selected outcomes to individuals.</p>
<p class="text">There are no cost-effectiveness analyses of risk-based delivery at
term for people with PDM; we considered costs associated with labor
induction and excess NICU admission to be most relevant; early delivery
based on risk assessment might lead to excess NICU admissions, which are
a driver of health care costs. The GDP estimated that the resources
required for implementation would be moderate, but whether additional
resources would be needed to proceed with early delivery is unclear; any
resources beyond those required for birth after expectant management
would be attributable to prolonged labor and delivery stay. Elective
labor induction may be associated with additional cost among low-risk,
nulliparous individuals at 39 weeks; however, the resources required
depend on the baseline risks for hypertensive disorders and cesarean
delivery, both of which are more common in people with diabetes
(<a href="200">200</a>,<a href="285">285</a>,<a href="286">286</a>). Shared decision-making about delivery timing is part of
routine obstetric care; therefore, risk-based delivery before 39 weeks
was judged to be feasible and acceptable and unlikely to require
additional resources. Although there are no validated risk assessment
tools, a standardized approach to delivery in pregnancies complicated by
diabetes may improve equitable care delivery and decrease disparities in
perinatal outcomes.</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation</p>
<p class="text">This recommendation is based on indirect evidence drawn from
retrospective cohort studies of individuals with PDM as well as RCTs in
individuals with either GDM or normal glucose. In all populations
including individuals with diabetes, delivery prior to 39 weeks is
associated with neonatal morbidity related to prematurity, primarily
respiratory, however expectant management at term is associated with
maternal morbidity and other neonatal morbidities including birth trauma
and stillbirth. Observational data suggests glycemia and other
comorbidities are important modifiers of the risk for adverse neonatal
and maternal outcomes. The GDP placed high value on the outcome of
stillbirth to support the conditional recommendation for delivery prior
to 39 weeks among individuals assessed to have multiple risk factors for
adverse outcomes.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Based on the available evidence, the panel concluded that in
individuals with preexisting diabetes, early delivery rather than
expectant management should be considered. The recommendation is based
in part on the lack of any validated obstetric risk assessment tools to
address the question. The panel considered expectant management, defined
as when intervention is delayed in favor of close monitoring of the
mother and fetus with the goal of prolonging pregnancy to achieve an
optimal perinatal outcome. The panel fully endorsed the judgement of the
health care providers, in conjunction with joint decision making with
the patient, to determine the optimal timing of delivery. The decisions
are based on diabetes related complications, obstetrical considerations
such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth and risk of
stillbirth. Based on the evidence presented in this summary, the panel
considered delivery no later than 38 6/7 weeks, even in those with ideal
glycemic control, as a timepoint when maternal and fetal risk of
morbidity begin to outweigh the benefits of expectant management.</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">We suggest research addressing the following questions:</p>
<p class="listlevel3">What is the role of social determinants of health in addition to
medical factors for predicting adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly
stillbirth?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Does the use of a risk assessment tool that incorporates the
clinically evident risk factors associated with maternal morbidity and
perinatal mortality to determine delivery timing reduce maternal
morbidity and perinatal mortality?</p>
<p class="h1">Postpartum Endocrine Care</p>
<p class="h2">Background</p>
<p class="text">The postpartum period, the time between delivery and 12 weeks post
partum, is a critical time for maternal and neonatal health. The
interpartum period is also critical for preparing for the next pregnancy
(<u>2019</u>). as postpartum care is often also PCC. Some components of
postpartum care include contraceptive and pregnancy planning, care for
diabetes and its complications, obesity care, lactation support,
management of postpartum hypertension, screening for depression, and
management of thyroid disorders (<a href="28">28</a>,<a href="200">200</a>,<a href="269">269</a>,<a href="287">287-289</a>). Special attention
is needed for diabetes complications such as nephropathy (<a href="290">290</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, many people with diabetes experience lapses in care in
both the immediate postpartum period and even during the first year
postpartum (<a href="291">291</a>,<a href="292">292</a>). Two common reasons for urgent visits and
readmission postpartum are hypertension and infection (<a href="293">293</a>). Women with
PDM have increased risk of severe maternal morbidity (and mortality)
postpartum (aOR, 1.25 [1.13–1.37]) (<a href="80">80</a>). PDM especially raises the risk
for de novo postpartum hypertension (13% vs. 3%; <span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.001)
and persistent postpartum hypertension (21.5 vs. 5.6%; <span class="italic">P</span> =
&lt;0.001) (<a href="294">294</a>). It is also a known risk factor for postpartum sepsis
(OR, 3.46; 95% CI: 3.014–3.83) (<a href="295">295</a>) and wound infection (<a href="296">296</a>).
Therefore, lapses in postpartum care are especially concerning in this
high-risk population.</p>
<p class="text">Rates of breastfeeding are much lower in women with PDM for various
reasons, including a higher rate of postpartum complications, fear of
hypoglycemia, lapses in postpartum diabetes care with resultant
variability in maternal glycemia, and lapses in lactation support
(<a href="297">297-302</a>). Additionally, lapses in care resulting in hyperglycemia and
decreased uptake of contraception and pregnancy planning could lead to
increased risk of congenital malformations and miscarriage in a future
pregnancy (<a href="3">3</a>,<a href="4">4</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Management of maternal glycemia postpartum is challenging, as this
period is characterized by dramatic changes in insulin requirements,
increasing the risk of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Insulin demand
decreases dramatically with delivery of the placenta (<a href="200">200</a>,<a href="303">303</a>), followed
by a gradual increase in insulin resistance in the weeks following
delivery. Hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal, is recognized as a problem
in lactating women, and this is cited as a reason some chose not to
breastfeed (<a href="236">236</a>,<a href="304">304</a>) (<a href="297">297</a>,<a href="305">305</a>). Advances in diabetes technology may help
reduce hyper- and hypoglycemia (<a href="168">168</a>); diabetes care increasingly relies
on advanced technology (CGMs and HCL pumps) as well as a rapidly
evolving array of oral and injectable pharmaceuticals. This complexity
highlights the importance of expert diabetes care in the postpartum
period (<a href="3">3</a>) (<a href="4">4</a>)</p>
<p class="h2">Question 10</p>
<p class="text">In postpartum individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM)
(including those with pregnancy loss or termination), should postpartum
endocrine care (comprehensive diabetes management), in addition to usual
obstetric care vs. usual obstetric care be used?</p>
<p class="h2">Recommendation 10 </p>
<p class="text">In individuals with pre-existing diabetes (including those with
pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest post-partum endocrine care
(diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care. (2 |
⊕OOO)</p>
<p class="h2">Technical Remark</p>
<p class="listlevel3">In addition to routine obstetric care, immediate postpartum care
for individuals with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (PDM) should
prioritize glycemic management to support healing, promote lactation,
and facilitate the transition to interpregnancy and long-term diabetes
management.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Ideally, postpartum diabetes care should be delivered by a
multidisciplinary team that includes physicians specializing in diabetes
and/or endocrinology, as well as nurses, dietitians, and certified
diabetes care and education specialists. This team should also support
ongoing, long-term established follow-up.</p>
<p class="listlevel3">In many cases, postpartum care also serves as preconception care
(PCC) for a future pregnancy. Approximately half of all deliveries occur
among individuals who already have at least one child, highlighting the
opportunity for postpartum care to contribute meaningfully to PCC. There
is strong evidence that preconception care improves several pregnancy
outcomes in individuals with PDM.</p>
<p class="h2">Summary of Evidence</p>
<p class="text">The meta-analysis results, a detailed summary of the evidence and EtD
tables can be found online at: <a
href="https://guidelines.gradepro.org/staging/profiles/b0DXzdWOGRA">https://guidelines.gradepro.org/profile/b0DXzdWOGRA</a> </p>
<p class="h2">Benefits and Harms</p>
<p class="text">The systematic review identified no RCT comparing postpartum
endocrine care (comprehensive diabetes management) plus usual obstetric
care versus usual care in individuals with PDM on the prespecified
outcomes of interest:</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Maternal severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia requiring medical
attention</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Glucometrics (TIR, TAR, and TBR)</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Maternal hypoglycemia</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Use of contraception</p>
<p class="listlevel3">HbA1C within the first year postpartum</p>
<p class="text">Indirect evidence from a previously described metanalysis
demonstrating that PCC reduces HbA1C and congenital malformation, ,
supports this recommendation (<a href="4">4</a>). This meta-analysis found that PCC
(generally delivered by a multidisciplinary team that included
endocrinologists and certified diabetes care and education specialists)
resulted in not only a lower HbA1C in the first trimester and a
reduction in congenital malformations but also a reduction in preterm
delivery by 15% (RR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73–0.99), perinatal mortality (RR,
0.46; 95% CI: 0.30–0.73), and NICU admissions (RR, 0.75; 95% CI:
0.67–0.84).</p>
<p class="text">Further indirect evidence to support this recommendation comes from
retrospective analysis of the Atlantic-Diabetes in Pregnancy
(Atlantic-DIP) program, a multidisciplinary intervention including
preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum endocrine care for individuals
with diabetes. In a retrospective chart review comparing 217 pregnancies
before the initiation of the Atlantic-DIP program with 228 after the
intervention was initiated (<a href="306">306</a>), there was a significant reduction in
first-trimester HbA1C (7.8% to 7.1%; <span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.001) following
the intervention, increased uptake of PCC (49% vs. 23%; <span class="italic">P</span> =
&lt;0.001), and an important reduction in congenital malformations (5%
to 1.8%; <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.04). Contraception uptake was not reported.
Further indirect evidence supports the need for increased postpartum
support in high-risk groups that included PDM. In an RCT comparing a
single 6-week with 2-week and 6-week postpartum obstetric visits, the
rate of urgent care visits decreased from 30% to 16% (<span class="italic">P</span> = 0.01)
(<a href="293">293</a>). Diabetes care was not specified, and diabetes complications were
not reported. A retrospective cohort study of individuals at high risk
for maternal morbidity (38.6% with diabetes) compared 2,590 enrolled in
a postpartum program (which included endocrine follow-up for diabetes)
with 3,229 not enrolled (<a href="306">306</a>). While measures of glycemia and uptake of
contraception were not reported, the adjusted incidence of all-cause
hospitalizations within 30 days postpartum was 20% lower among enrollees
(incident RR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.67–0.95). These studies suggest that more
frequent postpartum care is beneficial in high-risk groups.</p>
<p class="text">Indirect evidence from an RCT demonstrating that HCL technology
versus SAPT in the postpartum period reduces maternal hypoglycemia
supports this recommendation (<a href="307">307</a>). Participants (<span class="italic">n</span> = 18) in
the closed-loop arm had less TBR (defined as &lt;70 mg/dL/3.9nmol/L
[1.7% vs. 5.5%; <span class="italic">P</span> = &lt;0.001] and defined as &lt;54
mg/dL/3nmol/L [0.3 vs 1.1%; <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.008]). There were no episodes
of severe hyper- or hypoglycemia reported, and no difference in TAR or
TIR. HbA1C and contraceptive uptake were not reported. This study was
designed to and successfully did demonstrate the value of a
technological intervention; this would have been less feasible without
the support of a team with specific diabetes expertise.</p>
<p class="h2">Other Evidence-to-Decision Criteria and Considerations</p>
<p class="text">Hypoglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia in the postpartum period, at
times leading to cessation of breastfeeding, emerged as an overriding
concern among individuals in several studies (<a href="298">298</a>,<a href="308">308</a>,<a href="309">309</a>). Furthermore,
studies suggest that individuals with diabetes would prefer more support
including from diabetes specialists in the postpartum period
(<a href="293">293</a>,<a href="298">298</a>,<a href="308">308-312</a>).</p>
<p class="text">There are no publications on the cost or cost-effectiveness of
additional endocrine-focused postpartum care. Postpartum care could
potentially be cost saving if it reduced rates of readmissions,
increased rates of breastfeeding, and reduced rates of congenital
malformations in future pregnancies. The cost-effectiveness of PCC is
supported by a systematic review (<a href="33">33</a>).</p>
<p class="text">Factors associated with non-attendance of postpartum visits include
younger age, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, Medicaid insurance, mental
health disorders, lower socioeconomic status, decreased access to
prenatal care, adverse pregnancy outcomes, limited resources (e.g., lack
of access to care, limited childcare), and low health literacy
(<a href="291">291</a>,<a href="292">292</a>,<a href="313">313</a>) suggesting significant inequity in postpartum care. Higher
rates of follow-up were associated with specialist (including
endocrinologist) provider versus primary care (<a href="314">314</a>) suggesting that if
postpartum specialist visits were widely available to all individuals,
postpartum endocrine care might reduce inequities among individuals with
diabetes. Offering two postpartum visits (at 2 and 6 weeks) instead of
only one at 6 weeks improved overall attendance at one visit for
minority individuals in an RCT (<a href="293">293</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Justification for the Recommendation </p>
<p class="text">The GDP based its recommendation on very low–certainty indirect
evidence suggesting that post-partum endocrine care could result in
reductions in maternal hypoglycemia as well as in urgent visits and
readmissions in the immediate postpartum period and moderate to high
certainty evidence that PCC can reduce HbA1C and congenital
malformations in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, evidence suggests
concerns about diabetes management and desire for support from
individuals. The GDP judged that the risk of undesirable effects is low.
Therefore, the GDP concluded that the balance of effects probably favors
the intervention and that the evidence suggested it would be acceptable
to individuals. Costs would be moderate, but, based on the indirect
evidence of a preconception meta-analysis, it might be cost-effective.
Feasibility and equity would vary.</p>
<p class="h2">Comments </p>
<p class="text">Individuals who experience a pregnancy loss are even less likely to
receive postpartum care, despite being at increased risk for adverse
outcomes in the acute period (such as depression) and in future
pregnancies. Ditosto et al. provides a useful review of implementation
strategies (such as virtual reminders, mHealth applications, medical
home model, patient navigation, and postpartum transition clinics) for
postpartum care in this especially vulnerable population (<a href="313">313</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Implementation Considerations</p>
<p class="text">The feasibility of implementing postpartum endocrine care varies
across health care settings and may be particularly difficult in the US
where there is a shortage of physicians, including both endocrinologists
and obstetricians (<a href="315">315</a>,<a href="316">316</a>). Disadvantaged and minority populations must
be considered. Endocrine care should be provided by health care
specialists who have expertise in the care of diabetes and pregnancy.
Strategies to improve uptake include (but are not limited to) scheduling
postpartum care before delivery, flexibility in scheduling,
consideration of childcare needs, and use of telehealth. Saldanha et al.
conducted a systematic review of strategies for the delivery of
postpartum care (<a href="317">317</a>) and concluded that providing contraceptive care
early in the postpartum period was associated with greater uptake of
contraceptive use and that both peer support and support from a
lactation consultant increased rates of breastfeeding.</p>
<p class="h2">Research Considerations</p>
<p class="text">RCTs comparing usual obstetric care with usual care plus
endocrinologic/diabetes-focused care from hospital discharge to 12
months postpartum in individuals with diabetes are needed. Studies of
cost effectiveness, equity, implementation, and feasibility are also
required. Specific questions to be answered include:</p>

<p class="listlevel3">Does diabetes-focused care and reduction in maternal
hyperglycemia during the immediate postpartum period reduce the risk of
postpartum complications and costs, including hypertension, infections,
and emergency department/hospital admission rates?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Does expert glycemic management in the immediate postpartum
period reduce episodes of severe maternal hypoglycemia and improve
lactation rates and duration?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">In individuals with overweight/obesity, does early obesity
intervention in the postpartum period reduce BMI and cardiovascular risk
factors?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Does the inclusion of diabetes-focused care in the postpartum
period increase rates of PCC and contraceptive use, reduce unplanned
pregnancies and rates of congenital malformation, and improve HbA1C
level at 1 year and glucometrics?</p>
<p class="listlevel3">Does screening and interventions for diabetes distress reduce the
risk of postpartum depression?</p>
<p class="h1">Summary</p>
<p class="text">Using an evidence-based approach, Diabetes in Pregnancy: An Endocrine
Society Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues
in the management of T1DM and T2DM preconceptionally, during pregnancy,
and in the postpartum period.</p>
<p class="text">The prevalence of PDM has grown exponentially in the last two
decades, primarily due to a marked increase in the prevalence of T2DM.
PDM carries increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes,
including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia,
and congenital defects. PCC is very important to minimize the risk of
congenital defects as well as to maintain good glycemia in the
preconception phase and during pregnancy. PDM requires
pregnancy-specific diabetes care to reduce negative outcomes. In the
last few years, technology has progressed to address the unique
challenges individuals face in managing diabetes in pregnancy. CGM and
insulin pump technology have shown benefit by simplifying glycemic
monitoring and insulin administration. Improvements in glycemia and
perinatal outcomes have been reported with CGM use when compared with
SMBG. HCL pump systems combine CGM and insulin pump technologies with
increasingly sophisticated algorithms. As technology becomes more
integrated into the routine management of diabetes in pregnancy,
practitioners need to provide individualized device selection,
counseling, education and self-management support to ensure patient
autonomy and safety. Optimization of glycemia, correct dietary advice,
safe medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions
can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before,
during, and after pregnancy.</p>
<p class="text">Research and investment in implementation and delivery of PCC are
crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity now. RCTs to
further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging
technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of
harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and
obesity management in pregnancy are lacking, so clinical studies in this
context are necessary.</p>
